      "John Liu, CNN\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 3:36 PM GMT+7\n",
      "For proof that an economy can thrive even under constant military threats from a powerful neighbor and amid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, look no further than Taiwan.\n",
      "The self-ruled democracy has logged roughly 8% economic growth for two consecutive quarters, a rare achievement for a developed economy and one that is projected to push its 2025 GDP growth close to 7.4%, even surpassing China’s.\n",
      "“Taiwan’s economy has clearly been one of the best performing economies in the world, particularly over recent quarters,” said Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics. “Many people expected Taiwan’s economy to benefit from the sort of AI boom, but maybe many underestimated to what extent it would do.”\n",
      "Taiwan’s statistics bureau on Friday reported 8.21% year-on-year growth in GDP in the third quarter, driven by a 36.5% surge in exports in the period ending September. This followed an already striking 7.7% expansion in the second quarter.\n",
      "In October, exports hit a record high, climbing 49.7% from a year earlier – the largest single month increase in over 15 years.\n",
      "To top it all off, Taiwan’s stock market overtook Germany’s in September as the world’s eighth largest, riding on the global frenzy for artificial intelligence.\n",
      "But even as Taiwan’s economy flourishes, driven by the outsized influence of its high-tech sector as exemplified by the world-beating chipmaker TSMC, many citizens have been unable to share in the boom, as income gaps widen and wages remain stagnant.\n",
      "Economists say a key reason is that the gains are highly concentrated. Electronics manufacturing accounts for more than 15% of GDP but employs just 6.5% of the workforce, according to Capital Economics.\n",
      "This unevenness is partly reflected in sluggish consumer spending. Consumer confidence has remained subdued throughout the year, according to the index released by the Research Center of Taiwan Economic Development. Trump’s trade war has also dampened sentiment, economists say, particularly as Taiwan has yet to finalize a trade agreement with Washington.\n",
      "“From my perspective as a salaried worker earning above the median income, I feel the economy isn’t actually doing that well,” said Vivian Chen, a nurse in the Southern port city of Kaohsiung.\n",
      "Chen’s observations are echoed by many in the home of the global chip powerhouse. Taiwan’s GDP per capita is forecast to exceed $38,000 this year, outpacing South Korea and Japan. But its average wage lags both countries by at least 30%, according to CNN’s calculations of official data.\n",
      "Taiwan’s tech prowess, built over decades in the chip and electronics industries, has positioned the island to benefit from the AI boom. As tech giants from Google and OpenAI to Microsoft rush to build data centers powered by graphics processing units designed by Nvidia and AMD, Taiwanese companies have been at the forefront, manufacturing the semiconductors and servers essential for training AI models.\n",
      "In one prominent example, TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker that supplies Nvidia and is known by locals as the “protector of the nation,” has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, driven by the explosive growth in AI, after surpassing sales expectations in previous quarters.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Taiwan’s outbound shipments to the US, where most of the AI data center expansions have occurred, have grown more than 63% in the first 10 months of this year, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance.\n",
      "But questions have mounted about the sustainability of this export-driven boom, especially amid concerns that the AI frenzy could cool.\n",
      "Taiwan’s export growth “will definitely come down next year,” said Wang Jiann-Chyuan, vice president of the semi-official thinktank Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research. He expects growth to retreat from about 30% in recent quarters to single digits, as this year’s surge makes further expansion harder.\n",
      "Adding to the uncertainty is Trump, Wang said. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US hit a record this year, raising the risk of scrutiny from a president who has made reducing trade deficits a central goal of his tariff campaign.\n",
      "So far, chips and electronics, which made up more than 73% of Taiwan’s exports, have been spared from the levy. While Trump has repeatedly threatened triple-digit tariffs on semiconductors, he has exempted companies, including TSMC, that build manufacturing facilities in the United States.\n",
      "Still, the heavy concentration of exports in the high-tech sector has amplified concerns about over-reliance on a single industry — or even a single company. While chips and electronics now account for nearly three-quarters of exports, up from roughly half five years ago, traditional sectors such as metals, machinery, and plastics have seen little growth or outright decline.\n",
      "For Wu Jieh-min, a researcher at Taiwan’s top research institute Academia Sinica, however, part of the concern about the island’s economic future are associated with many Taiwanese people’s deep-seated insecurity about its political status. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to absorb it by force, if necessary.\n",
      "“I think the cautious, on-edge mindset you see across Taiwanese society is very obvious, and I actually see it as something positive,” said Wu, whose research focuses on political economy and sociology.\n",
      "“We have to manage our own future very carefully, because even just surviving is already difficult for us,” he said.\n",
      "On the ground, some Taiwanese say the rosy headline figures don’t reflect their daily lives, like Chen, the nurse, who said salaries for health professionals feel stagnant.\n",
      "“That’s why you hear doctors complaining about being underpaid, and why so many nurses are leaving the country or the industry altogether,” Chen said.\n",
      "“People in Taiwan keep hyping themselves up, saying things like ‘We have TSMC,’ or boasting about how high the stock market is. But for many living here, their monthly pay stayed much the same,” she added.\n",
      "GT Lin, an AI engineer in Taipei, echoed that sentiment.\n",
      "“That’s why I’ve come to the conclusion that the country is strong, but the people aren’t necessarily wealthy,” he said.\n",
      "Taiwan’s real wage growth, adjusted for inflation, began to slow in the late 1990s and has remained stagnant since the early 2000s. Labor’s share of GDP peaked at about 50% in the 1990s and has since fallen to around 44%.\n",
      "Roy Ngerng, a Singaporean labor activist based in Taipei who has written extensively about the issue of wage stagnation in Taiwan, attributed the problem to long-term wage suppression — aimed at boosting export competitiveness.\n",
      "He said that while Taiwan’s economy has seen exceptional growth in recent years – and booming profits among tech businesses – average workers and employees in other sectors have been mostly left out, widening the income disparity.\n",
      "Just five years ago, wages in the electronics sector were already 35% above the economy-wide average, according to Capital Economics. Now they are more than 70% higher.\n",
      "Ngerng added that the current government has been steadily increasing the minimum wage.\n",
      "Wu Tsong-Min, an economist at National Taiwan University, however, notes that wage stagnation is “not unique to Taiwan,” as many advanced economies face similar issues, particularly among low-skill workers.\n",
      "Wu, the author of “A 400-Year History of Taiwan’s Economy,” also pointed out that Taiwan’s GDP per capita, after adjusted for purchasing power, rises further thanks to lower domestic prices.\n",
      "Still, housing remains a major burden: Taipei’s house price-to-income ratio has nearly tripled in the past two decades, surpassing London, New York and even Hong Kong, according to the Global Property Guide.\n",
      "For Wu of Academia Sinica, he remains optimistic, saying that the thriving tech industry could generate spillover effects that trickle down to other sectors.\n",
      "“Taiwan’s economy wasn’t shaped by deliberate planning or an exceptionally capable government, but rather an evolutionary process,” he said.\n",
      "While the size of Taiwan’s economy is dwarfed by leading global powers, Wu added, its small and medium-sized enterprises are nimble, adaptable and attuned to global trends.\n",
      "“That’s how its semiconductor industry became what it is today.”\n",

      "Another step forward in the fast-growing partnership between the European Union and the countries of Central Asia was made during the 3rd EU–Central Asia Economic Forum, that took place in Uzbekistan’s capital, Tashkent.\n",
      "Following this year’s EU–Central Asia Summit in Samarkand (Uzbekistan), the ministerial meeting in Ashgabat (Turkmenistan), and President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s visit to Brussels in Belgium, the forum became the latest milestone in a year that has elevated cooperation to a new strategic level.\n",
      "It brought together business leaders, investors, and government representatives from 32 countries. The European delegation was led by EU Commissioners Jozef Síkela and Marta Kos. Síkela highlighted the importance of 2025 for the partnership, calling it “The Year of Europe” for Central Asia as President Mirziyoyev defined it.\n",
      "“We are moving from potential to implementation — in digital connectivity, clean energy and transport. Today, I announced three new contracts on critical raw materials that will strengthen governance and open new opportunities for both regions,” Síkela told to Euronews.\n",

      "Matteo Patrone, vice president of banking at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), underlined the group's growing presence in Central Asia, with almost €21 billion invested across 1,227 projects to date.

      "William Tompson, head of the OECD’s Eurasia Division, described the forum as one of the region’s most significant economic diplomacy events.\n",
      "“The forum comes just shortly after the EU and Uzbekistan have signed their Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which means that Uzbekistan itself now has a much better relationship and much better market access with the European Union. Since 2017, reforms in Uzbekistan have moved at an impressive pace and attracted international attention. Today, six new projects were launched, including one for the Aral Sea region.”\n",

      "Colin Jarvis' team works on high-value projects in the \"tens of millions to sometimes the low billions.\"\n",
      "The forward-deployed engineering model has gained traction in the tech world in recent months.\n",
      "A team at OpenAI embeds itself inside some of the world's biggest companies to turn AI models into real-world deployments.\n",
      "Colin Jarvis, who leads OpenAI's forward-deployed engineering team, explained in an episode of the \"Altimeter Capital\" podcast published Thursday how his team helps companies generate \"tens of millions to sometimes the low billions\" in value.\n",
      "The team is still small: 39 engineers, with plans to grow to 52 by year-end, Jarvis said. OpenAI lists 24 openings for the forward-deployed engineering team in the US, Europe, and Japan, with salaries in the US topping out at $345,000, plus equity, according to the job postings.\n",
      "The term \"forward-deployed engineer\" was popularized by Palantir, the defense tech software giant. It describes engineers who work directly with clients to fine-tune the product on-site.\n",
      "When ChatGPT came out in 2022, the model sparked \"tons of hype.\" \"People were really excited, but it was also, like, kind of hard to get value from the models,\" Jarvis said.\n",
      "Early enterprise customers struggled to translate that excitement into usable systems. Jarvis said the only consistently successful approach was to embed directly with clients, learn their workflows, and work alongside their staff. This led OpenAI to set up a forward-deployed model.\n",
      "One of the team's major projects was with Morgan Stanley, which became one of OpenAI's first enterprise customers to deploy GPT-4.\n",
      "The technical scaffolding took six to eight weeks, but convincing financial advisors to trust the tech took far longer, Jarvis said. The team had to spend another four months running pilots, collecting evaluations, and iterating with wealth advisors.\n",
      "\"In the end, about 98% of them adopted it,\" he said.\n",
      "The team also worked with a semiconductor company in Europe to build a \"debug investigation and triage agent\" that could examine failures and fix bugs. They looked across the company's value chain and realized engineers were spending 70% to 80% of their time debugging chips, Jarvis said.\n",
      "Jarvis said that forward-deployed engineering teams have to be clear about their purpose. His team avoids \"services revenue\" and is focused on creating product playbooks, he added.\n",
      "Earlier this year, Jarvis announced in a LinkedIn post that he would be leading OpenAI's new forward-deployed engineering function.\n",
      "\"Our focus is getting our customers to production, whether it's through a zero-to-one novel application of our tech or helping you to scale proven cases,\" he wrote in January.\n",

      "He added that he would terminate millions of admissions under his predecessor Joe Biden and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.” Trump also said he would end all federal benefits for non-citizens.\n",
      "“These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized and illegal Autopen approval process,” Trump said, using a reference to the Biden administration. “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”\n",
      "Trump offered no details on how he would implement these policies or what he considers a “third world” country, an ill-defined and often offensive term for developing nations. Congress for years has failed to pass major immigration reforms, and courts have blocked some of his previous executive orders limiting immigration.\n",
      "The post followed an attack Wednesday on two National Guard members in Washington by an Afghan national, an assault that Trump had used to amplify his anti-immigration policies. Earlier in the day, the president had announced the death of one of the guardsman, US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20.\n",
      "After the shooting, the White House halted Afghan immigration proceedings and ordered a review of those already in the US. The administration had already planned to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden and freeze their green card applications, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg this month.\n",
      "The US has admitted more than 190,000 Afghans since the 2021 fall of Kabul to the Taliban, mostly those who assisted US forces and their families during the war.\n",
      "On Thursday, Joseph Edlow, the head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a social media post that his agency — under Trump’s orders — is conducting “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”\n",
      "The White House in June announced a ban on immigration from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and Sudan, and restrictions on seven others. In his first term, Trump barred travelers from Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.\n",
      "Trump has also pursued aggressive immigration enforcement, deploying teams to cities over the objections of local officials and amid claims that authorities are wrongfully deporting migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections.\n",
      "The administration has sharply reduced the refugee admissions cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by tech companies and universities, and revoked thousands of visas. It is also challenging the constitutional right to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.\n",
      "Upon returning to office in January, Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions, which was promptly challenged in court. An appeals court allowed new admissions to be paused as the litigation continues, but ordered the government to provide services to refugees who already had arrived.\n",

      "The move by the company, which runs China's largest search engine, comes shortly after it reported a third-quarter loss ‌on November 18. The sources added that the layoffs were expected to run until the end of this year. Reuters was not able to establish the ‌companywide number of jobs being cut but the sources said it was internally perceived to be large-scale. The layoff numbers varied by business unit and performance ratings and could reach as high as 40% for some teams, two of the people said.\n",

      "The mobile ecosystem group will bear the brunt of the cuts, two sources said.\n",
      "However, roles tied to AI and cloud computing will largely be protected, said four of the ⁠people. One of the sources said more resources ‌would be directed to AI. The sources declined to be named as the information is private. Baidu's workforce stood at 35,900 at the end of last year, down from ‍39,800 in 2023 and 41,300 a year earlier, according to its annual reports. Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The cuts follow Baidu's second straight quarterly revenue decline; total revenue fell 7% and online advertising revenue dropped 18% in the third quarter. It ​also posted a loss of 11.23 billion yuan ($1.59 billion) for the period. Baidu ‌has spent years investing in AI, but those efforts have yet to revive growth in its core online advertising business, which has ceded market share to social media platforms like RedNote and ByteDance's Douyin. Although Baidu was the first major Chinese tech firm to roll out a ChatGPT-style service in 2023, it has struggled to maintain an early lead against competitors including Alibaba and AI start-up DeepSeek. Baidu's Ernie large language model is trailing offerings from rivals including Alibaba and DeepSeek after multiple strategy shifts, ⁠including a move to open source it earlier this year. ​Adoption has also lagged. In September, Baidu's Ernie Bot app had 10.​77 million monthly active users, lower than 150 million for ByteDance's Doubao and 73.4 million for DeepSeek, according to AI product tracker Aicpb.com. Baidu has focused its AI push on embedding the technology ‍into existing products, including search,⁠ and says more than half of its mobile search result pages now include AI-generated content. Job reductions have become a common tool for major Chinese internet companies seeking to cut costs in a highly competitive sector. Alibaba ⁠and Tencent slashed tens of thousands of jobs in 2022 to cope with a broad regulatory crackdown on China's major internet platforms.

      "Gravis Robotics, a Zurich-based startup that is turning heavyweight construction machines into autonomous robots, has raised $23 million to expand its operations in the U.K., U.S., and EU. The funding was led by IQ Capital and Zacua Ventures, with participation from Pear VC, Imad, Sunna Ventures, Armada Investment, and Holcim. Gravis plans to use the funds to build more machines and expand partnerships with construction firms.\n",
      "Founded in 2022, Gravis is trying to solve one of the construction industry’s key problems—a looming talent shortage. A large proportion of skilled machine operators are nearing retirement, and not enough younger workers are entering the field to replace them, co-founder and CEO Ryan Luke Johns told Fortune.\n",
      "“There’s a massive peak in demand for renewable, resilient infrastructure, which means we need more operators—and there just isn’t enough,” he said. “It’s not a sexy job. It’s not a job that any young person really wants to go into.”\n",
      "Across the U.K., Europe, and the U.S., governments are building wind farms and grid infrastructure to meet clean‑energy goals, tech companies are rushing to construct huge data centers to power AI, and cities desperately need more housing. The talent shortage threatens to slow all of this, potentially driving up costs and stretching timelines on projects that power everything from renewable energy to the servers running ChatGPT.\n",
      "The autonomous construction equipment market is in demand, partly driven by this surge in infrastructure development projects. The industry was valued at $8.8 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at over 7.5% annually through 2032, according to Global Market Insights.\n",
      "Part of the reason construction work is becoming increasingly unattractive for humans is that operators face a high risk of injury. Johns told Fortune that Gravis’ technology aims to address such concerns by reducing risky tasks, like surveying or marking out work areas, while keeping humans in control. The company adds cameras, sensors, and AI to existing excavators, loaders, and other heavy machines so they can operate autonomously or with remote guidance via Gravis’ Slate tablet.\n",
      "“Our technology is actually bringing other young people to want to do this job,” he added. “Because you’re looking at a tablet, instead of sitting behind joysticks.”\n",
      "Gravis’ machines are already in use in seven countries across four continents, including Europe, the U.S., Latin America, and Asia. The company has worked with clients including Holcim, Taylor Woodrow, and HD Hyundai. In the U.K., Gravis has been conducting trials of autonomous excavation with Taylor Woodrow at Manchester Airport.\n",
      "“The fastest path to autonomy is delivering productivity today,” Johns said. “By giving operators real-time 3D intelligence and the ability to shift seamlessly between autonomy and guided control, we cover more of the work, accelerate adoption, and create the data pipeline needed to learn new capabilities from the industry’s hardest jobs.”\n",
      "Johns says Gravis is not aiming for fully unmanned construction sites. Instead, its systems work alongside humans, learning from complex and changing sites while boosting productivity. As demand grows for housing, renewable energy projects, and safer infrastructure, Gravis believes its AI and sensors can help contractors get more work done efficiently and safely.\n",
      "“Gravis stands out, not just for its technical brilliance, but for how much it’s already achieved. The team’s thoughtful, grounded approach to autonomy—deploying real systems with real crews—has led to trusted partnerships with some of the largest global construction companies and [original equipment manufacturers] and invaluable data from time-in-field,” said Archie Muirhead, partner at IQ Capital. “This huge and unserved market is ready now for autonomy.”\n",
      "The company is entering a competitive market dominated by equipment giants like Caterpillar, Komatsu, and Volvo Group, and startups including San Francisco-based Built Robotics, which has raised over $100 million since 2016. Industry adoption also faces a few barriers, including high upfront costs that smaller contractors struggle to justify and regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — Black Friday bargains no longer tempt people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs. Brawls in store aisles over toys and TVs with limited-time discounts are spectacles of holidays past. Online shopping and retailers launching discounts weeks before the turkey feast subdued that kind of fervor.\n",
      "But the sales event still has enough enthusiasts to make the day after Thanksgiving the one when U.S. stores get the most shoppers coming in the door. For that reason, Black Friday still rules as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.\n",
      "This year's kickoff comes as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday.\n",
      "Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect.\n",
      "“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said this week of shoppers' moods heading into Black Friday. \"But business surveys also report consumers are being more sensitive to prices and selective in spending.\"\n",
      "While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the volatility of President Donald Trump ’s wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers.\n",
      "Market research firm Circana said that 40% of all general merchandise sold in September saw a price increase of at least 5% compared with the first four months of the year.\n",
      "Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. For example, 83% of toys sold in September saw an increase of at least 5%, Circana said. Industry group The Toy Association says nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, a country the Trump administration hit with especially high tariffs at various points this year.\n",
      "Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, foot traffic in recent weeks surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, said Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer.\n",
      "“We're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,\" Renslow said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”\n",
      "The growth in online sales also has been robust so far. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, according to web tracking and analysis platform Adobe Analytics. That represented a gain of 7.5% from a year earlier and was bigger than Adobe's 5.3% growth forecast for the season.\n",
      "Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods, predicted a 3.6% increase in holiday sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year.\n",
      "“Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.”\n",
      "According to Adobe Analytics, Thanksgiving Day was the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods. But Black Friday will be the best time to buy TVs, toys and appliances online.\n",
      "Cyber Monday, however, should be the best time to buy apparel and computers. Apparel discounts peaked at 12.2% off the suggested manufacturer’s price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23 but are expected to hit 25% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.\n",

      "Decentralized finance protocol Balancer has outlined a framework to return millions in rescued assets to liquidity providers after an exploit drained more than $128 million from its V2 pools, in what was one of the largest DeFi exploits of the year.\n",
      "The proposal published Thursday by two members of the protocol’s community is seeking community feedback on plans to distribute roughly $8 million in funds, “including both whitehat rescues and internal recovery efforts.”\n",
      "The discussion comes in the aftermath of Balancer’s exploit early this month, which drained millions across five chains, forced emergency pauses, and prompted whitehat interventions.\n",
      "Approximately $28 million of the stolen funds were salvaged through a mix of whitehat interventions, internal rescues, and third-party actions, as per the proposal.\n",
      "\"Incidents like this show how important it is for DeFi to have clear, real-time visibility into what’s happening on-chain,\" Blockscout, an open-source block explorer for EVM-based chains, told Decrypt. \"The more transparent and traceable protocols become, the faster the ecosystem can respond, contain damage, and recover funds.\"\n",
      "The framework covers only the $8 million recovered directly by whitehats and Balancer’s internal teams, while Ethereum-based liquid staking protocol StakeWise will separately return the remaining $19.7 million in osETH and osGNO to its own users through its governance process.\n",
      "\"The Safe Harbor Agreement, adopted by Balancer DAO, provides clear terms for whitehat interventions,\" the proposal notes, specifying bounties are paid in the same tokens as recovered funds and cannot be retained directly from rescued assets.\n",
      "Balancer Exploited for $128 Million Across Ethereum Chains as Berachain Halts Network\n",
      "The proposal takes a non-socialized approach to reimbursement, meaning each affected pool's recovered funds will be distributed only to liquidity providers of that specific pool and network, rather than spreading losses across all users.\n",
      "Distributions will be proportional to holdings at specific snapshot blocks taken just before the first exploit transaction.\n",
      "Whitehat rescuers who intervened during the attack will receive a 10% bounty, capped at $1 million per operation, once they complete legal ID disclosure, KYC checks, and sanctions screening, according to the platform.\n",

      "Balancer also conducted an internal rescue operation, coordinating with security firm Certora, recovering an additional $4.1 million from vulnerable metastable pools across Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum that were at risk but not yet exploited.\n",
      "These internally rescued funds won't qualify for SEAL Safe Harbor bounties since Certora operated under an existing service relationship with Balancer, and the agreement specifically incentivizes external actors rather than coordinated internal responses, as per the proposal.\n",

      "Brent oil has fallen 15% this year, with prices hurt by expectations for a global glut after OPEC+ restarted capacity, while drillers outside the alliance also added supplies.

      "Catastrophe bonds — as the name may suggest — aren’t for fledgling investors. Even so, these high-yield, high-risk securities are attracting growing interest as natural catastrophes intensify.\n",
      "First developed for the US market in the 1990s, cat bonds are issued by governments, insurers, or reinsurers to cover the costs of natural disasters. Investors buy the instrument in the hope that a payout won’t be triggered, meaning they’ll get their money back plus a return. Alternatively, in the case of a bond-triggering natural disaster, the issuer will keep the capital to cover the fallout.\n",
      "“From the perspective of insurers and reinsurers, cat bonds provide access to an alternative source of capital that is more flexible than on-balance sheet capital and can be targeted towards absorbing specific types and layers of risk,” said Brandan Holmes, VP-senior credit officer at Moody’s Ratings. “Cat bonds can also be more cost effective than traditional reinsurance,” he told Euronews.\n",
      "The appeal of these securities has gained prominence in the wake of recent disasters like Jamaica’s Hurricane Melissa. Crucially, capital markets provide nations with a vital means to lower insurance costs at a time when aid spending in rich countries is dropping. Repeated natural disasters can push governments into insurmountable debt, particularly as the cost of servicing those dues becomes higher.\n",
      "From an investor perspective, the instrument also has its perks. Not only do the bonds carry attractive yields because of their risky nature, they provide portfolio diversification because of their limited correlation with financial markets. This means that when stocks and typical bonds fall at the same time — an uncommon but real scenario — catastrophe bonds offer some protection. “They also tend to have relatively short maturities which provide investors with flexibility in asset allocation decisions,” said Holmes.\n",
      "According to data firm Artemis, the outstanding value of the global cat bond market is around $57.9 billion (€49.93bn). Despite the growing climate risk, these assets also saw historically strong returns in 2023 and 2024, reaching 20% and 17% respectively.\n",
      "One factor boosting returns is that investors only pay out if certain conditions are met. For example, when Hurricane Beryl hit Jamaica last year, the nation failed to get any cat bond coverage when air pressure failed to drop below a certain threshold. On the other hand, in the wake of this year’s Hurricane Melissa, Jamaica will receive a full payout of $150 million (€129.37mn) thanks to its World Bank catastrophe insurance.\n",
      "Analysts stress that the complex conditions surrounding cat bonds make the product unsuitable for inexperienced investors. “You have to have a really good understanding of the risk passed on,” said Maren Josefs, credit analyst at S&P Global. She added: “What we’ve also seen recently is investors presuming they are investing in extreme events, like a really big hurricane or earthquake. But over the last few years, mid-sized events such as tornadoes, wildfires, or floods have been happening with greater frequency, meaning some investors were surprised when they lost money to these sorts of natural disasters.”\n",

      "Institutional investors are currently the key purchasers of cat bonds. However, there are ways for retail investors to gain indirect exposure to the product. Earlier this year, the world’s first ETF (exchange traded fund) investing in cat bonds made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, meaning fund managers can now pool investor contributions to buy cat bonds. In the EU, the instruments aren’t easy for non-professionals to access, but indirect exposure is possible through UCITS, a type of mutual fund.\n",
      "“The actual cat bond that gets issued, there's no way that either a US or EU retail investor can just buy that,” said Johannes Schahn, an associate at Mayer Brown who advises on debt issuance. “They’re only offered to qualified investors,” he continued, “but what has been happening occasionally is that mutual funds invest or partially invest in cat bonds.”\n",
      "Despite the perks of these securities, their availability may be further restricted in the EU in the coming years. This comes after a report from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), sent to the European Commission this summer, advising that cat bonds shouldn’t be included in UCITS. The market watchdog clarified that UCITS should only hold a small indirect exposure of up to 10% to these instruments.\n",
      "While ESMA’s recommendation has ignited conversations around the risks of cat bonds for non-professional investors, Kian Navid, senior policy officer for investment management at ESMA, told Euronews that the advice sent to the Commission wasn’t passing a value judgement on the investments. “It is not that ESMA’s technical advice takes a position against retail investors accessing cat bonds per se. The advice is not about outlining what constitutes a good or bad investment, but it provides data and risk analyses for the European Commission’s consideration,” he explained. “However, conceptually, if you opened up UCITS to alternative assets (like cat bonds) beyond 10%, that would risk blurring the lines between UCITS and alternative investment funds (AIFs).”\n",
      "A decision from the Commission is still pending, and this will involve public consultations and further market analysis in 2026. Even so, it remains to be seen whether catastrophe bonds will appeal to European tastes.\n",
      "“It’s a product that is established in the US market and less so in Europe,” said Patrick Scholl, partner at Mayer Brown. “I don’t know if there are many interested investors here… But if we see more catastrophe-driven developments in the region, we might see more of these products in Europe.”\n",

      "The troubled Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will add £1bn annually to UK energy bills as soon as it’s switched on, official figures show.\n",
      "The money will be taken from consumers and handed to the French owner EDF to subsidise operations, making it one of the UK’s most expensive sources of electricity.\n",
      "A further £1bn will be added to bills by a separate nuclear levy, supporting construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, also led by EDF. Campaigners branded it a “nuclear tax on households”.\n",
      "Details were revealed in documents released by the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility in the wake of Rachel Reeves’s Budget.\n",
      "They describe how EDF will be entitled to claim the money under the “Contracts for Difference” subsidy system as soon as Hinkley C begins operations, probably in 2030.\n",
      "The documents state: “In 2030-31, Contracts for Difference (CfDs) are expected to generate £4.6bn in government receipts, including £1bn to fund subsidy payments to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant for its first year of expected generation.”\n",
      "The impact on bills is linked to a 2013 agreement reached between EDF and Sir Ed Davey, the then energy secretary. He guaranteed that EDF could charge £92.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) of power once Hinkley Point C came online. With inflation, this equates to £133 today and is expected to reach about £150 in 2030.\n",
      "If the wholesale cost of electricity remains at its current level of about £80/MWh, then EDF can claim an extra £70 from consumers and businesses via CfDs.\n",
      "From January, energy bills will also be hit by an entirely separate levy designed to support the construction of another nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk.\n",
      "The Regulated Asset Base levy will add £10 a year to power bills from 2026, raising £700m, but will roughly double by 2030, when it will need to raise £1.4bn a year for Sizewell.\n",
      "Official modelling suggests Sizewell C’s final costs could reach £100bn.\n",
      "Bills could rise even further once approval is given for another nuclear site on Anglesey in north Wales, where the UK’s first small modular reactors are planned.\n",
      "Alison Downes, of Stop Sizewell C, said nuclear power had proven to be among the most expensive ways of generating electricity.\n",
      "She said: “The Government has a misguided belief that nuclear will be a cheap, ‘green’ solution to our energy needs, but the evidence shows the opposite – that costs of delivery and of dealing with nuclear waste – will continue to rise.\n",
      "“We remain opposed to the imposition of a nuclear tax on households, given the acknowledged uncertainty about the projected costs of constructing Sizewell C.”\n",
      "The surging cost of CfDs is part of a much broader increase in energy-related environmental levies. These add £14bn to energy bills at the moment, but this will rise to £19bn by the end of the decade, according to Treasury forecasts.\n",
      "The CfD subsidy system, which also supports wind and solar, currently costs consumers and businesses £2.3bn a year, but those costs will hit £4.6bn by 2030-31.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Renewables Obligation, which funded the UK’s first wind farms, adds costs of £8bn a year.\n",
      "The Capacity Market, which pays gas-fired power stations and hydroelectric facilities to be on standby in case wind and solar are hit by low wind and light levels, adds a further £1.6bn.\n",
      "A government spokesman said the subsidies were necessary to unleash its planned “golden age of nuclear power”.\n",
      "They said: “Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C will each deliver clean electricity for six million households for at least six decades. Sizewell C could save £2bn a year across the future low-carbon electricity system once operational, resulting in cheaper power for consumers.”\n",
      "Hinkley C was initially forecast to cost £18bn, but spiralling construction costs have pushed the total bill to £46bn, equivalent to £700 per person in the UK.\n",

      "The surging cost of CfDs is part of a much broader increase in energy-related environmental levies. These add £14bn to energy bills at the moment, but this will rise to £19bn by the end of the decade, according to Treasury forecasts.\n",
      "The CfD subsidy system, which also supports wind and solar, currently costs consumers and businesses £2.3bn a year, but those costs will hit £4.6bn by 2030-31.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Renewables Obligation, which funded the UK’s first wind farms, adds costs of £8bn a year.\n",
      "The Capacity Market, which pays gas-fired power stations and hydroelectric facilities to be on standby in case wind and solar are hit by low wind and light levels, adds a further £1.6bn.\n",
      "A government spokesman said the subsidies were necessary to unleash its planned “golden age of nuclear power”.\n",
      "They said: “Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C will each deliver clean electricity for six million households for at least six decades. Sizewell C could save £2bn a year across the future low-carbon electricity system once operational, resulting in cheaper power for consumers.”\n",
      "Hinkley C was initially forecast to cost £18bn, but spiralling construction costs have pushed the total bill to £46bn, equivalent to £700 per person in the UK.\n",

      "Moline, Illinois-based Deere & Company (DE) is a leading American multinational headquartered in Moline, Illinois, and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of agricultural, construction, forestry, and turf-care equipment. Founded in 1837, the company has evolved from producing steel plows to advanced machinery for precision agriculture and heavy equipment for infrastructure and forestry. Deere operates through key segments including Production & Precision Agriculture, Small Agriculture & Turf, Construction & Forestry, and Financial Services, supplying equipment and financing solutions to customers globally.\n",
      "Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \"large-cap stocks.\" Deere fits right into that category, with a market cap of $127 billion that exceeds this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance in the farm & heavy construction machinery industry.\n",

      "Despite its notable strengths, DE stock has plunged 12% from its all-time high of $533.78 touched on May 16. Meanwhile, the stock has dropped 3.7% over the past three months, notably underperforming the broader Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 7.8% rise during the same time frame.\n",
      "However, over the longer term, Deere’s performance has remained much more impressive. DE stock has surged 10.9% on a YTD basis and 1.9% over the past 52 weeks, notably outperforming NASX’s 20.2% uptick in 2025 and 21.1% surge over the past year.\n",
      "DE stock has remained mostly below its 200-day moving average since early September. But the stock has traded mostly above its 50-day moving average recently.\n",
      "On Nov. 26, DE announced its Q4 2025 performance and its shares dropped 5.7%. Its net sales and revenues fell 9% year-over-year to $12.02 billion, driven by broad softness across its core equipment businesses. Net income declined sharply to $1.29 billion or $4.75 per share from $1.73 billion or $6.29 per share a year earlier, and operating profit dropped 32% to $1.57 billion as margins compressed.\n",
      "The downturn was led by the Production & Precision Agriculture segment, where sales fell 16% and operating profit slid 50%, while Construction & Forestry also saw sales down 5% and profit nearly halved. The company cited challenging market conditions, weaker equipment demand, and macro headwinds, and narrowed its full-year net-income guidance to $4.75–$5.25 billion, dampening investor sentiment.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Deere’s peer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) has gained 58.2% on a YTD basis and 40.7% over the past year, outperforming DE.\n",
      "Among the 23 analysts covering the DE stock, the overall consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” Its mean price target of $525.77 suggests an 11.9% upside potential from current price levels.\n",

      "Moline, Illinois-based Deere & Company (DE) is a leading American multinational headquartered in Moline, Illinois, and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of agricultural, construction, forestry, and turf-care equipment. Founded in 1837, the company has evolved from producing steel plows to advanced machinery for precision agriculture and heavy equipment for infrastructure and forestry. Deere operates through key segments including Production & Precision Agriculture, Small Agriculture & Turf, Construction & Forestry, and Financial Services, supplying equipment and financing solutions to customers globally.\n",
      "Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \"large-cap stocks.\" Deere fits right into that category, with a market cap of $127 billion that exceeds this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance in the farm & heavy construction machinery industry.\n",

      "Despite its notable strengths, DE stock has plunged 12% from its all-time high of $533.78 touched on May 16. Meanwhile, the stock has dropped 3.7% over the past three months, notably underperforming the broader Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 7.8% rise during the same time frame.\n",
      "However, over the longer term, Deere’s performance has remained much more impressive. DE stock has surged 10.9% on a YTD basis and 1.9% over the past 52 weeks, notably outperforming NASX’s 20.2% uptick in 2025 and 21.1% surge over the past year.\n",
      "DE stock has remained mostly below its 200-day moving average since early September. But the stock has traded mostly above its 50-day moving average recently.\n",
      "On Nov. 26, DE announced its Q4 2025 performance and its shares dropped 5.7%. Its net sales and revenues fell 9% year-over-year to $12.02 billion, driven by broad softness across its core equipment businesses. Net income declined sharply to $1.29 billion or $4.75 per share from $1.73 billion or $6.29 per share a year earlier, and operating profit dropped 32% to $1.57 billion as margins compressed.\n",
      "The downturn was led by the Production & Precision Agriculture segment, where sales fell 16% and operating profit slid 50%, while Construction & Forestry also saw sales down 5% and profit nearly halved. The company cited challenging market conditions, weaker equipment demand, and macro headwinds, and narrowed its full-year net-income guidance to $4.75–$5.25 billion, dampening investor sentiment.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Deere’s peer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) has gained 58.2% on a YTD basis and 40.7% over the past year, outperforming DE.\n",
      "Among the 23 analysts covering the DE stock, the overall consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” Its mean price target of $525.77 suggests an 11.9% upside potential from current price levels.\n",

      "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.\n",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.\n",
      "“It’s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.”\n",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.\n",
      "Congress opened the door in 2018\n",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. “Rope, not dope” was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.\n",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.\n",
      "But the way that law defined hemp — as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 — opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.\n",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.\n",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.\n",
      "A patchwork of state regulations\n",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.\n",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.\n",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.\n",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.\n",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery’s taproom.\n",
      "A powerful senator moves to close the loophole\n",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.\n",
      "“It will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,” McConnell said. “Industrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.”\n",
      "Some in the legal marijuana industry celebrated, as the ban would end what they consider unfair competition.\n",
      "They were joined by prohibitionists. “There’s really no good argument for allowing these dangerous products to be sold in our country,” said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana.\n",
      "But the ban doesn't take effect for a year. That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry — such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children — rather than eradicate it.\n",
      "\"We are very hopeful that cooler heads will prevail,\" said Jonathan Miller, general counsel of the industry group U.S. Hemp Roundtable. “If they really thought there was a health emergency, there would be no year-long period.”\n",
      "The federal ban would jeopardize more than 300,000 jobs while costing states $1.5 billion in lost tax money, the group says.\n",
      "Drew Hurst, president and chief operating officer at Bauhaus Brew Labs, has no doubt his company would be among the casualties.\n",
      "“If this goes through as written currently, I don’t see a way at all that Bauhaus could stay in business,\" Hurst said.\n",
      "What comes next?\n",
      "A number of lawmakers say they will push for regulation of the hemp THC industry. Kentucky's second senator, Republican Rand Paul, introduced an amendment to strip McConnell's hemp language from the crucial government-funding bill, but it failed on a lopsided 76-24 vote.\n",
      "Minnesota's Democratic U.S. senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, are among those strategizing to save the industry. Klobuchar noted at a recent news conference that the ban was inserted into the unrelated shutdown bill without a hearing. She suggested the federal government could allow states to develop their own regulatory frameworks, or that Minnesota's strict regulations could be used as a national model.\n",
      "Kevin Hilliard, co-founder of Insight Brewing in Minneapolis, said the hemp industry needs a solution before planting time next spring.\n",
      "\"If a farmer has uncertainty, they’re not going to plant,” Hilliard said.\n",

      "Two new BofA reports warn holiday spending may tighten as prices keep rising.\n",
      "Shoppers may feel the pinch as inflation, tariffs, and higher costs put a strain on their budgets.\n",
      "Electronics and jewelry could see the sharpest pullback as tariffs drive up prices.\n",
      "Santa won't be the only one tightening his belt this year — the American consumer is already feeling the pinch, and many haven't even finished digesting their Thanksgiving stuffing. As we head into Black Friday weekend, the forecast for holiday shoppers may be chilly: prices on consumer goods are rising faster than is comfortable for many gift-givers, according to two recent reports by Bank of America.\n",
      "Sixty-two percent of the more than 2,000 respondents to Bank of America's holiday survey, conducted in late summer, said they expected financial strain tied to holiday expenses, and 58% say gifts feel more expensive.\n",
      "More than half of the respondents pointed to tariffs as a suspected cause. The firm found that tariffs announced this spring likely contributed to price increases in categories such as electronics and jewelry, goods often purchased as holiday gifts.\n",
      "Holiday spending per household is up about 6% according to the bank's card data, yet retail transaction volumes have declined slightly over the course of the year. The takeaway: shoppers are shelling out more, only to walk away with less.\n",
      "BofA's reports also point to a widening chasm in how those along different income brackets are likely to experience the season's bounty.\n",
      "Higher-income households continue to show spending and wage growth that outpace everyone else. Many white-collar professionals, such as Wall Street investment bankers, are expected to have surging bonus years, according to forecasts, which is likely to hand six-figure year-end incentive pay for higher-income earners.\n",
      "For everyone else, the most wonderful time of the year is already fomenting stress at the checkout counter.\n",
      "Electronics spending per transaction jumped nearly 8% in a single month after the spring tariffs, and jewelry spending rose about four percentage points after an August tariff announcement, the bank found. Add in record-high gold prices this year — which have made gold-based pieces costlier — and suddenly, holiday gift-giving has relinquished some of its luster.\n",
      "With rising prices leaving some shoppers with fewer items to buy, survey respondents say they're getting more selective about who will end up on their \"naughty\" or \"nice\" lists.\n",
      "Thirty-eight percent say they'll only buy gifts for immediate family and close friends, while 23% have agreed with relatives to scale back their gift-giving.\n",
      "Among those feeling financial strain, 87% plan to shop at discount stores to counter rising prices, and 51% say they'd consider gifting a \"dupe,\" a cheaper imitation of a luxury item. More than half said they planned to kick off their shopping sprees earlier than usual to spread out expenses, the survey found.\n",
      "Card data showed that spending by high earners increased roughly 3% over the past year, compared with less than 1% for lower-income households. The firm said wage growth followed a similar split — after-tax pay rose about 4% for higher earners, but only about 1% for those at the bottom. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, is warning that the labor market is softening across tech, manufacturing, and other sectors, which could squeeze those already on the edge.\n",
      "That means, with prices climbing and paychecks under pressure, holiday shoppers may be left wondering who's actually going to come down the chimney this year: Santa Claus with a sack of toys, or the Grinch, offering only an inflationary pinch.\n",

      "UK automotive production plunged in October, with combined car and commercial vehicle output falling 30.9% year-on-year to 62,116 units, according to new data released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The sharp contraction reflects both the ongoing fallout from a major cyber incident that disrupted operations at Britain’s largest carmaker and wider structural pressures in the country’s auto sector.\n",
      "Car production dropped 23.8% to 59,010 units, leaving factories 18,474 vehicles short of October 2024 levels. The decline marks the first month of a phased restart following the cyberattack that forced a temporary production halt earlier this autumn. Output for the domestic market fell 10.6% to 13,785 units, while exports slid 27.1% to 45,225. Shipments to the UK’s largest overseas markets, particularly the EU, US and Japan, recorded declines, though exports to Türkiye and China rose.\n",
      "Commercial vehicle manufacturing endured an even steeper decline, tumbling 74.9% to just 3,106 units, its seventh consecutive monthly drop. The SMMT attributed the collapse primarily to a major manufacturer consolidating its operations in the North West, a move that has temporarily depressed national volumes.\n",
      "Despite the grim headline figures, one bright spot was the continued rise of electrified vehicle production. Nearly half of all cars built in October, 46.2%, were battery-electric, plug-in hybrid or hybrid models. Electrified output rose 10.4% to 27,287 units, underscoring the UK industry’s pivot toward EV manufacturing even as domestic demand remains under pressure.\n",
      "The production update comes two days after the UK government’s Autumn Budget, which included several measures welcomed by manufacturers. These included a £1.5 billion increase in Automotive Transformation Fund support, a deferral of regulations affecting employee car ownership schemes, and the launch of a consultation on a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme aimed at reducing industrial energy costs, long a sticking point for UK manufacturers competing with international rivals.\n",
      "However, industry leaders warned that new tax measures could weaken the UK’s appeal just as policymakers are trying to attract major EV investment. The government confirmed plans for a new pay-per-mile electric vehicle tax (eVED), a move that could suppress EV demand at the very moment automakers are required to increase sales under the country’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate.\n",
      "“In introducing a new electric vehicle Excise Duty, the government risks undermining demand for the very vehicles manufacturers are compelled to sell,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes. “This is the wrong measure at the wrong time.”\n",
      "Year-to-date, UK factories have produced 644,366 vehicles, down 17% from the same period in 2024. Yet the latest independent outlook from Auto Analysis forecasts a return to growth in 2026, with output expected to reach 828,000 units as new electric models come online. Under favourable industrial conditions, UK production could climb toward 1 million units by 2030, the report suggests.\n",
      "The SMMT cautioned that October’s data includes provisional figures from one manufacturer and may be revised. The next production release is scheduled for 19 December 2025.\n",

      "Hong Kong-listed Anta has been working with an adviser to evaluate a bid for Puma, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The company may team up with a private equity firm if it decides to move forward with an offer, some of the people said.\n",
      "Puma shares surged 19% in Frankfurt trading Thursday, the most since October 2001.\n",
      "Other potential bidders could include rival Chinese apparel firm Li Ning Co., the people said. Li Ning, named after the legendary gymnast who founded the company, has been discussing financing options with banks as it takes an early look at Puma, the people said. Puma may also attract interest from sportswear companies such as Japan’s Asics Corp., the people said.\n",
      "Deliberations are preliminary and it’s unclear which suitors will proceed with bids, the people said. The valuation expectations of Puma’s biggest shareholder, France’s billionaire Pinault family, may represent a major hurdle to any transaction, the people said.\n",
      "Before Thursday’s bounce, Puma shares had dropped 62% in Frankfurt this year, giving the company a market value of €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion).\n",
      "The Pinault family’s Artémis holding company owned 29% of Puma at the end of last year, according to the firm’s annual report.\n",
      "Anta — which owns brands including Fila and Jack Wolfskin — has gained 10% in Hong Kong trading this year, giving the company a market value of $31 billion. An Anta-led consortium, which also included Asian buyout firm FountainVest Partners, paid $5.2 billion in 2019 to acquire Amer Sports, the owner of brands like Salomon and Arc’teryx. Amer then held an initial public offering in New York last year, with Anta staying on as its biggest investor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n",
      "Li Ning’s stock has risen about 7% in 2025, for a market value of $5.8 billion.\n",
      "A representative for Anta didn’t respond to requests for comment, while representatives for Artémis and Puma declined to comment. Asics said in a statement Friday that it wasn’t in talks and had no plans to acquire Puma.\n",

      "Hong Kong-listed Anta has been working with an adviser to evaluate a bid for Puma, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The company may team up with a private equity firm if it decides to move forward with an offer, some of the people said.\n",
      "Puma shares surged 19% in Frankfurt trading Thursday, the most since October 2001.\n",
      "Other potential bidders could include rival Chinese apparel firm Li Ning Co., the people said. Li Ning, named after the legendary gymnast who founded the company, has been discussing financing options with banks as it takes an early look at Puma, the people said. Puma may also attract interest from sportswear companies such as Japan’s Asics Corp., the people said.\n",
      "Deliberations are preliminary and it’s unclear which suitors will proceed with bids, the people said. The valuation expectations of Puma’s biggest shareholder, France’s billionaire Pinault family, may represent a major hurdle to any transaction, the people said.\n",
      "Before Thursday’s bounce, Puma shares had dropped 62% in Frankfurt this year, giving the company a market value of €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion).\n",
      "The Pinault family’s Artémis holding company owned 29% of Puma at the end of last year, according to the firm’s annual report.\n",
      "Anta — which owns brands including Fila and Jack Wolfskin — has gained 10% in Hong Kong trading this year, giving the company a market value of $31 billion. An Anta-led consortium, which also included Asian buyout firm FountainVest Partners, paid $5.2 billion in 2019 to acquire Amer Sports, the owner of brands like Salomon and Arc’teryx. Amer then held an initial public offering in New York last year, with Anta staying on as its biggest investor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n",
      "Li Ning’s stock has risen about 7% in 2025, for a market value of $5.8 billion.\n",
      "A representative for Anta didn’t respond to requests for comment, while representatives for Artémis and Puma declined to comment. Asics said in a statement Friday that it wasn’t in talks and had no plans to acquire Puma.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 8:00 AM GMT+7\n",
      "From the beginning of Donald Trump’s first term in office in 2017 to the start of his second term earlier this year, the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia shifted between tense and downright hostile. Those years included an Oil Price War, the de facto Saudi leader labelled a murderer, and all lines of communication between the two sides grinding to a complete halt. However, as Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) sat next to each other at a black?tie dinner at the White House last week – with the former designating the latter’s country as “a major non-NATO ally” -- all this must have seemed a distant past, and as L.P. Hartley put it: “They do things differently there”. So, how does the future for the world’s top superpower and one of its top hydrocarbons powers look from here?\n",
      "It is apposite to note here that this is not a meaningless designation from the U.S. for Saudi Arabia. Only 19 other countries -- Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia – have such a standing in Washington’s eyes. Taiwan also has the same de facto designation, but does not officially enjoy the label, given the U.S.’s complicated ‘One China’ policy. Saudi Arabia’s new-found status also brings with it a host of economic and military advantages in its dealings with the U.S. and its allies, according to the State Department. These include eligibility for ‘loans of material, supplies, or equipment for cooperative research, development, testing, or evaluation purposes’, as well as for being a location for the placing of U.S.-owned War Reserve Stockpiles. Saudi Arabia will also now be able to enter into agreements with the U.S. for its security forces’ training on a bilateral or multilateral basis, will be eligible for the priority delivery of ‘excess defence articles’ (including C-130 Hercules aircraft or frigates, at low or zero cost), and for the purchase of depleted uranium ammunition. It will also be entitled to enter into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense for research and development projects on defence equipment and munitions, and to procure explosives detection devices and other counter-terrorism research and development projects, among many other advantages. In short, Saudi Arabia is officially now regarded by the U.S. and its allies – including NATO members – as ‘one of ours’.\n",
      "Related: OPEC+ Expected to Extend Pause on Oil Hikes as Prices Stay Weak\n",
      "That said, this unofficial designation – and the official ‘major non-NATO ally’ counterpart – comes with its own obligations for Saudi Arabia. Beginning from a broad perspective, the Kingdom will be expected to tilt more towards the interests of the U.S. and its allies than those of the China-Russia bloc, regardless of the issue, and regardless of what has gone before. The years of cosying up with China after the devastating financial impact of the 2014-2016 Oil Price War of OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, on the U.S. and its allies -- analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order – are expected to count for nothing going forward. Nor is the adjunct relationship normalisation deal brokered by China between Saudi Arabia and Iran, as the same highly-placed Washington-based legal source exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “In any direct conflicts of interest like this, we [the U.S.] expect Saudi to be on our side from now on,” he underlined. A firmer line from Saudi Arabia is expected by the U.S. to be drawn on the issue of the Kingdom’s earlier drift towards the formal economic, political, and security cooperation structures with China and Russia at their centres. This particularly applies to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) which Saudi Arabia joined as a ‘dialogue partner’ in March 2023. And Saudi Arabia’s continued support for the ongoing expansion of China’s multi-generational power-grab project, ‘The Belt and Road Initiative’ is also expected by Washington to be toned down. This equally carries through into Saudi Aramco’s dealings with China, which had been characterised by chief executive officer Amin Nasser in the comment: “Ensuring the continuing security of China’s energy needs remains our highest priority – not just for the next five years but for the next 50 and beyond,” as also fully detailed in my latest book.\n",
      "Instead of its formerly Sino-centric posture, Saudi Arabia is now expected by Washington to adopt an actively positive stance in the rollout of Trump’s broader vision for the Middle East. Just as in his first presidential term, this involves building out ‘relationship normalisation’ deals between key Arab states and the U.S.’s longstanding core ally in the region – Israel. This ‘Abraham Accords’ initiative had seen some success in that first term in office, with notable signatories being the UAE and Bahrain, before Trump’s tenure was cut short by his loss to Joe Biden in November 2020. However, there had been signs from MBS even then that he might look favourably on the Kingdom signing such a deal, albeit at a point after King Salman’s death. Given Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic and mediatory stance during the recent Israeli attacks on Hamas and Iran – themselves a response to the murder, torture and rape of hundreds of Israeli citizens by Hamas on 7 October 2023 – Washington is quietly confident that an ‘Abraham Accord’ by whatever name will be reached between Saudi Arabia and Israel in the near future. Indeed, Saudi Arabia (alongside Qatar – another ‘major non-NATO ally’, and Oman) reportedly relayed messages between Tehran and mediators from the U.S.-Israeli side, helping to shape ceasefire conditions.\n",
      "The final part of Saudi Arabia’s obligations from the U.S. side will be full cooperation on the oil price. Specifically, Washington expects active assistance in the oil markets to keep oil prices within the ‘Trump Oil Price Range’, as fully analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order. Suffice it to say here, this sits roughly between a Brent price floor of US$40–45 per barrel (pb, the breakeven price plus a bit of profit for the bulk of U.S. shale oil producers) and a ceiling of US$75–80 pb (which ties into historical data showing that a gasoline price of under US$2 per gallon has been most advantageous for U.S. economic growth) – and the range is critical to Trump from an economic and political perspective. On the former, historical data highlights that every US$10 pb or so change in the price of crude oil results in around a 25-30 cent change in the price of a gallon of gasoline, and for every 1 cent that the average price per gallon of gasoline rises, more than US$1 billion or so per year in consumer spending is lost. On the latter, since 1896, the sitting U.S. president has won re-election 11 times out of 11 if the economy was not in recession within two years of an upcoming election. However, sitting U.S. presidents who went into a re-election campaign with the economy in recession won only once out of seven occasions. The same pattern broadly applies to the re-election chances of candidates of any sitting president’s party in U.S. mid-term elections as well. Trump may find a way to run again for President, but even if he does not, his Republican Party will want to optimise their chances for another of their members to be in the top job.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 8:00 AM GMT+7\n",
      "From the beginning of Donald Trump’s first term in office in 2017 to the start of his second term earlier this year, the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia shifted between tense and downright hostile. Those years included an Oil Price War, the de facto Saudi leader labelled a murderer, and all lines of communication between the two sides grinding to a complete halt. However, as Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) sat next to each other at a black?tie dinner at the White House last week – with the former designating the latter’s country as “a major non-NATO ally” -- all this must have seemed a distant past, and as L.P. Hartley put it: “They do things differently there”. So, how does the future for the world’s top superpower and one of its top hydrocarbons powers look from here?\n",
      "It is apposite to note here that this is not a meaningless designation from the U.S. for Saudi Arabia. Only 19 other countries -- Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia – have such a standing in Washington’s eyes. Taiwan also has the same de facto designation, but does not officially enjoy the label, given the U.S.’s complicated ‘One China’ policy. Saudi Arabia’s new-found status also brings with it a host of economic and military advantages in its dealings with the U.S. and its allies, according to the State Department. These include eligibility for ‘loans of material, supplies, or equipment for cooperative research, development, testing, or evaluation purposes’, as well as for being a location for the placing of U.S.-owned War Reserve Stockpiles. Saudi Arabia will also now be able to enter into agreements with the U.S. for its security forces’ training on a bilateral or multilateral basis, will be eligible for the priority delivery of ‘excess defence articles’ (including C-130 Hercules aircraft or frigates, at low or zero cost), and for the purchase of depleted uranium ammunition. It will also be entitled to enter into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense for research and development projects on defence equipment and munitions, and to procure explosives detection devices and other counter-terrorism research and development projects, among many other advantages. In short, Saudi Arabia is officially now regarded by the U.S. and its allies – including NATO members – as ‘one of ours’.\n",
      "Related: OPEC+ Expected to Extend Pause on Oil Hikes as Prices Stay Weak\n",
      "That said, this unofficial designation – and the official ‘major non-NATO ally’ counterpart – comes with its own obligations for Saudi Arabia. Beginning from a broad perspective, the Kingdom will be expected to tilt more towards the interests of the U.S. and its allies than those of the China-Russia bloc, regardless of the issue, and regardless of what has gone before. The years of cosying up with China after the devastating financial impact of the 2014-2016 Oil Price War of OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, on the U.S. and its allies -- analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order – are expected to count for nothing going forward. Nor is the adjunct relationship normalisation deal brokered by China between Saudi Arabia and Iran, as the same highly-placed Washington-based legal source exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “In any direct conflicts of interest like this, we [the U.S.] expect Saudi to be on our side from now on,” he underlined. A firmer line from Saudi Arabia is expected by the U.S. to be drawn on the issue of the Kingdom’s earlier drift towards the formal economic, political, and security cooperation structures with China and Russia at their centres. This particularly applies to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) which Saudi Arabia joined as a ‘dialogue partner’ in March 2023. And Saudi Arabia’s continued support for the ongoing expansion of China’s multi-generational power-grab project, ‘The Belt and Road Initiative’ is also expected by Washington to be toned down. This equally carries through into Saudi Aramco’s dealings with China, which had been characterised by chief executive officer Amin Nasser in the comment: “Ensuring the continuing security of China’s energy needs remains our highest priority – not just for the next five years but for the next 50 and beyond,” as also fully detailed in my latest book.\n",
      "Instead of its formerly Sino-centric posture, Saudi Arabia is now expected by Washington to adopt an actively positive stance in the rollout of Trump’s broader vision for the Middle East. Just as in his first presidential term, this involves building out ‘relationship normalisation’ deals between key Arab states and the U.S.’s longstanding core ally in the region – Israel. This ‘Abraham Accords’ initiative had seen some success in that first term in office, with notable signatories being the UAE and Bahrain, before Trump’s tenure was cut short by his loss to Joe Biden in November 2020. However, there had been signs from MBS even then that he might look favourably on the Kingdom signing such a deal, albeit at a point after King Salman’s death. Given Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic and mediatory stance during the recent Israeli attacks on Hamas and Iran – themselves a response to the murder, torture and rape of hundreds of Israeli citizens by Hamas on 7 October 2023 – Washington is quietly confident that an ‘Abraham Accord’ by whatever name will be reached between Saudi Arabia and Israel in the near future. Indeed, Saudi Arabia (alongside Qatar – another ‘major non-NATO ally’, and Oman) reportedly relayed messages between Tehran and mediators from the U.S.-Israeli side, helping to shape ceasefire conditions.\n",
      "The final part of Saudi Arabia’s obligations from the U.S. side will be full cooperation on the oil price. Specifically, Washington expects active assistance in the oil markets to keep oil prices within the ‘Trump Oil Price Range’, as fully analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order. Suffice it to say here, this sits roughly between a Brent price floor of US$40–45 per barrel (pb, the breakeven price plus a bit of profit for the bulk of U.S. shale oil producers) and a ceiling of US$75–80 pb (which ties into historical data showing that a gasoline price of under US$2 per gallon has been most advantageous for U.S. economic growth) – and the range is critical to Trump from an economic and political perspective. On the former, historical data highlights that every US$10 pb or so change in the price of crude oil results in around a 25-30 cent change in the price of a gallon of gasoline, and for every 1 cent that the average price per gallon of gasoline rises, more than US$1 billion or so per year in consumer spending is lost. On the latter, since 1896, the sitting U.S. president has won re-election 11 times out of 11 if the economy was not in recession within two years of an upcoming election. However, sitting U.S. presidents who went into a re-election campaign with the economy in recession won only once out of seven occasions. The same pattern broadly applies to the re-election chances of candidates of any sitting president’s party in U.S. mid-term elections as well. Trump may find a way to run again for President, but even if he does not, his Republican Party will want to optimise their chances for another of their members to be in the top job.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. sued a former executive who left to work for Intel Corp., saying there is a high likelihood that he leaked trade secrets from the world’s most advanced chipmaker to his new employer.\n",
      "TSMC said it filed the lawsuit against Lo Wei-jen, a former senior vice president, on Tuesday at the Intellectual Property and Commercial Court in Taiwan. It said the legal action was based on a non-compete agreement that Lo had signed during his employment. A spokesperson for the court confirmed it received a lawsuit from TSMC on Tuesday.\n",

      "The unusual action from TSMC underscores the growing sensitivities around cutting-edge chip technology, which anchors not just the company’s leading global position but also Taiwan’s own geopolitical dynamic. The company regularly loses employees to competitors and other firms in the supply chain — but rarely of Lo’s standing and seniority.\n",
      "“There is a high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses, delivers, or transfers TSMC’s trade secrets and confidential information to Intel, thus making legal actions (including claiming damages for breach of contract) necessary,” TSMC said in a statement.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. sued a former executive who left to work for Intel Corp., saying there is a high likelihood that he leaked trade secrets from the world’s most advanced chipmaker to his new employer.\n",
      "TSMC said it filed the lawsuit against Lo Wei-jen, a former senior vice president, on Tuesday at the Intellectual Property and Commercial Court in Taiwan. It said the legal action was based on a non-compete agreement that Lo had signed during his employment. A spokesperson for the court confirmed it received a lawsuit from TSMC on Tuesday.\n",

      "The unusual action from TSMC underscores the growing sensitivities around cutting-edge chip technology, which anchors not just the company’s leading global position but also Taiwan’s own geopolitical dynamic.

      "Investors have been swamped with headlines comparing today’s market, particularly the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, to dot-com days. “Big Short” investor Michael Burry has also joined the “AI bubble” chorus, launching his Substack after deregistering Scion Asset Management. While comparing Nvidia’s (NVDA) price action over the last three years to that of Cisco (CSCO) in the late 1990s has been a pastime for many, the latest comparison has come in terms of dividend yield, with the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) dividend yield falling to lows last seen during the dot-com days.\n",

      "But several companies not only survived the dot-com bust, but thrived. Microsoft (MSFT), for instance, surpassed its 1999 peak in 2015 and has briefly jostled for the position of the world’s most valuable company. However, after a strong first half, Microsoft shares have looked weak and are down over 7% in the last three months, while the drawdown from the 2025 peak is just over 16%.\n",
      "Microsoft’s dividend yield currently stands at 0.77%, which, although below historical averages, is the highest among its “Magnificent 7” peers. Notably, MSFT shouldn’t be singled out for having a dividend yield below historical averages, as the S&P 500’s dividend yield has also fallen and is inching toward 1%.\n",
      "Here, it is worth noting that dividend yield is a function of both the dividend and the stock price. While Microsoft is on the verge of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat after raising its dividend every year since initiation in 2003, the growth in stock price has more than outpaced dividend growth, pulling down the yield.\n",
      "That said, I find Microsoft stock to be a good buy after the recent underperformance, with its relatively healthy dividend yield compared to Big Tech peers being a cherry on top.\n",
      "Before analyzing Microsoft’s outlook, let’s examine why the stock has come off its highs after closing at a record ahead of its fiscal Q1 2026 earnings release last month. The stock fell after that report despite a beat on both the top line and the bottom line as the company said that it expects the growth in the current fiscal year’s capex to be higher than the previous one.\n",
      "Previously, Microsoft had said that it expects fiscal 2026 capex growth to be below fiscal 2025, and the company even rationalized its AI spending by canceling some data center leases. While rising AI capex is music to the ear of Nvidia investors, as much of it will land in the company’s coffers, investors in hyperscalers like Microsoft are fretting over the spending spree, questioning whether companies will be able to make enough return on these investments.\n",
      "Notably, Microsoft is the biggest external investor in OpenAI, and in the most recent quarter, it booked a net loss of $3.1 billion as its share of losses in the company. The losses are taking a toll on Microsoft’s bottom line even as the investment has grown 10x, thanks to OpenAI’s soaring valuations.\n",
      "Apart from AI bubble fears, I don’t find anything particularly wrong with Microsoft’s business. The company’s revenue streams are quite diversified and spread across the core Windows and Office franchises, premium subscription products, advertising, cloud, gaming, and LinkedIn. I find it a good buy for 2026, as the company is literally firing on all cylinders. While strong demand for AI PCs is aiding Microsoft's Windows and Office business, AI is fueling demand for subscription and cloud business. The cloud business is particularly growing at a brisk pace, and Microsoft is closing the gap with market leader Amazon (AMZN).\n",
      "I have been skeptical about Microsoft’s valuations in the past, but at these levels I find it attractive, as while the recent fall in MSFT’s stock has bumped up its dividend yield, its valuations have taken a beating, with the forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple falling to just under 30x. The multiples look reasonable to me, considering where the broader market valuations stand and Microsoft’s historical multiples over the last few years. Moreover, tech companies’ valuation multiples would look ugly over the next few quarters as the aggressive AI capex would eat into profits in the form of higher depreciation. Overall, I am betting on Microsoft stock and have added to my existing positions amid the market selloff.\n",

      "Will a Ukraine Peace Deal Really Lure Europe Back to Russian Gas?\n",

      "As the Trump Administration looks to broker a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, analysts and traders seek to anticipate how a potential agreement could change energy flows in Europe.\n",
      "To be sure, a peace deal is far from certain, as stumbling blocks and differences remain, while Russia has not weighed in on the plan yet. White House envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Moscow next week to discuss the peace plan with the Kremlin as Russia appears reluctant to accept any offer that doesn’t fully meet all its demands.\n",
      "Even if a deal is reached – and this is not the base case scenario of many traders and observers – it is unlikely to change Europe’s reluctance to return to the Russian energy dependence which it has fought so hard to shake off. Most analysts say even a clean ceasefire wouldn’t meaningfully shift Europe’s stance after 2022.\n",
      "Going off Russian pipeline gas cost European households and industries a lot as energy bills and industry costs surged. More than three years after the energy crisis began to take its toll on Europe’s cost of living and competitiveness, the prospect of eased energy flows from Russia is not particularly appealing to most of the EU.\n",
      "No Turning Back\n",
      "Russian gas has not been banned in the EU, and will not be for another year. As-is, the EU aims to stop LNG imports from Russia from 2027.\n",
      "It’s unlikely that a peace deal would reverse Europe’s course to cut off dependence on Russian energy once and for all.\n",
      "Europe also doesn’t have an easy way to restart Russian pipeline flows even if a peace deal landed tomorrow. Nord Stream is physically destroyed, Yamal–Europe has been shut since Poland terminated its contract, and Ukraine’s own transit agreement with Gazprom expires next year with no political appetite to renew it. The hardware, contracts, and politics simply don’t line up for a quick return.\n",
      "Related: UK Risks Gas Shortages in 2030s as Domestic Output Plunges\n",
      "“Even if sanctions on Russia's energy sector were eased, European governments would be reluctant to re-embrace Moscow as a core supplier after the shock of 2022,” Reuters columnist Ron Bousso wrote in his opinion column this week.\n",
      "Indeed, most EU member states haven’t received Russian gas for three years and many don’t plan to return depending on the Kremlin for supply even if a fair peace deal for Ukraine is reached.\n",
      "After three difficult years, and especially winters, with soaring gas prices in Europe, this year prices have held in a narrow trading range despite the fact that European gas storage sites were filling at a slower pace ahead of the winter compared to previous years. Storage levels are about 10 percentage points lower than at this time last year and the five-year average. As of November 25, gas storage sites across the EU were about 77% full, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe.\n",
      "Despite the lower levels of gas in storage, the market appears to believe that Europe will have enough supply this winter, mostly thanks to record U.S. LNG exports, most of which are going to Europe right now.\n",
      "Even if Russian pipeline gas magically came back into play, Europe has already rebuilt its entire supply picture around LNG.\n",
      "Strong LNG Flows Ease Winter Supply Concerns\n",
      "The U.S. exported 10.1 million metric tons of LNG in October, per data from LSEG cited by Reuters, becoming the first country ever to ship out more than 10 million metric tons in a single month. The start-up of Venture Global’s Plaquemines export project and the ramp-up of Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Stage 3 facility led the increase.\n",
      "Europe took almost 69% of all U.S. LNG exports last month, the LSEG data showed.\n",
      "The U.S. is set to further boost its LNG exports in the coming months and years.\n",
      "The U.S. is expected to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) this month. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.\n",
      "The supply wave of U.S. LNG will continue through this decade as LNG developers are taking advantage of market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.\n",
      "Supply from Qatar is also set to rise as the world’s second-largest LNG exporter after the U.S. is hiking production and export capacity in the biggest LNG expansion ever. Qatar looks to boost its export capacity by a whopping 85% from current levels by 2030.\n",
      "The LNG supply wave is good news for Europe, if the EU moves to significantly scale back its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which places additional barriers to LNG flows to Europe, and even penalties on companies.\n",
      "The EU is working to rewrite the proposed legislation, fearing its supply security is at stake.\n",
      "With the start of the winter heating season amid lower-than-usual inventories, Europe’s gas prices haven’t spiked as in previous winters.\n",
      "On the contrary, the benchmark price at the TTF hub in Amsterdam slipped below the key threshold of 30 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh) this week, for the first time in a year and a half, amid strong LNG flows, milder temperatures, and negotiations about the end of the war in Ukraine.\n",
      "In a sign that gas supply conditions in France and Europe have stabilized, French supermajor TotalEnergies will demobilize its LNG floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) in the port of Le Havre, which was installed in 2022 to serve as a “safety net” for gas supply. The floating terminal is no longer necessary, TotalEnergies said this week.\n",
      "Another sign of a well-supplied market is that portfolio managers have turned increasingly bearish on European gas.\n",
      "The latest positioning data showed that speculators shifted from a net long to a net short position on the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) futures for the first time since March 2024, according to ING.\n",
      "“The move was once again driven by fresh shorts entering the market, which pushed the gross short to yet another record high,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said on Thursday.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 6:21 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame posted four stock picks on Wednesday.\n",
      "The investor and writer touted Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, and Fannie Mae.\n",
      "Burry recently shut his hedge fund to outside money, shifting his focus to publishing a Substack.\n",
      "Michael Burry has broken free from the shackles of financial regulation — and he's making the most of his newfound liberty by sharing his favorite stocks.\n",
      "The prescient investor of \"The Big Short\" fame closed his hedge fund to outside cash this month, saying he felt \"muzzled\" by SEC rules and wanted to speak freely via his new Substack, fittingly titled \"Cassandra Unchained.\"\n",
      "\"You know I own and like LULU, MOH, FOUR,\" Burry wrote in a Wednesday post. \"Also FNMA, but as a pink sheet stock, it was never disclosed. These are all 3-5 year holds minimum. I will write each of these up as well as others in future posts. The 2-12B market cap range is the most fertile area as I see it today.\"\n",
      "Burry also said it's a \"great time of year to find great companies being sold down too far as a result of window dressing and tax-loss harvesting.\" He explained that \"many managers do not like to show they have owned big losers at the end of the year,\" but that doesn't bother him.\n",
      "The four tickers posted by Burry refer to Lululemon Athletica, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, and the Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as \"Fannie Mae.\"\n",
      "Lululemon is an athletic-apparel retailer known for its premium yoga pants. Molina provides affordable health insurance and healthcare services, primarily to low-income and senior Americans. Shift4 Payments is a fintech that provides payment processing and various commercial tools to the likes of hotels, restaurants, stadiums, and online retailers.\n",
      "Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that supports the US housing market by guaranteeing over $4 trillion worth of mortgages against credit losses, making it easier and cheaper for Americans to buy homes.\n",
      "The first three have popped up in Scion Asset Management's portfolio updates over the past 12 months or so, while Fannie Mae shares trade on over-the-counter markets, so Burry's firm didn't have to disclose them in its 13F filings.\n",
      "Burry is famous for successfully shorting the mid-2000s housing bubble and frequently predicting crashes and recessions.

      "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame posted four stock picks on Wednesday.\n",
      "The investor and writer touted Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, and Fannie Mae.\n",
      "Burry recently shut his hedge fund to outside money, shifting his focus to publishing a Substack.\n",
      "Michael Burry has broken free from the shackles of financial regulation — and he's making the most of his newfound liberty by sharing his favorite stocks.\n",
      "The prescient investor of \"The Big Short\" fame closed his hedge fund to outside cash this month, saying he felt \"muzzled\" by SEC rules and wanted to speak freely via his new Substack, fittingly titled \"Cassandra Unchained.\"\n",
      "\"You know I own and like LULU, MOH, FOUR,\" Burry wrote in a Wednesday post. \"Also FNMA, but as a pink sheet stock, it was never disclosed. These are all 3-5 year holds minimum. I will write each of these up as well as others in future posts. The 2-12B market cap range is the most fertile area as I see it today.\"\n",
      "Burry also said it's a \"great time of year to find great companies being sold down too far as a result of window dressing and tax-loss harvesting.\" He explained that \"many managers do not like to show they have owned big losers at the end of the year,\" but that doesn't bother him.\n",
      "The four tickers posted by Burry refer to Lululemon Athletica, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, and the Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as \"Fannie Mae.\"\n",
      "Lululemon is an athletic-apparel retailer known for its premium yoga pants. Molina provides affordable health insurance and healthcare services, primarily to low-income and senior Americans. Shift4 Payments is a fintech that provides payment processing and various commercial tools to the likes of hotels, restaurants, stadiums, and online retailers.\n",
      "Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that supports the US housing market by guaranteeing over $4 trillion worth of mortgages against credit losses, making it easier and cheaper for Americans to buy homes.\n",
      "The first three have popped up in Scion Asset Management's portfolio updates over the past 12 months or so, while Fannie Mae shares trade on over-the-counter markets, so Burry's firm didn't have to disclose them in its 13F filings.\n",
      "Burry is famous for successfully shorting the mid-2000s housing bubble and frequently predicting crashes and recessions. He's a deep-value investor who specializes in spotting bargains, especially smaller, beaten-down stocks. Year to date, Lululemon shares have tanked 52%, Molina shares have tumbled 49%, and Shift4 Payments shares have plunged 32%.\n",

      "Sentiment in oil markets remains overwhelmingly negative, driven by perceived market oversupply and negative global demand indicators. Brent crude for January delivery was trading at $63.10 per barrel in Thursday’s intraday session, little changed from $62.97 a week ago while the corresponding WTI contract ticked up slightly to $58.70/bbl from $58.46. Meanwhile, the recent rally in oil product prices has cooled off, with ICE Gasoil-Brent crack dropping from a 35.84/bbl peak on 18 November to ~$26/bbl. This is partly due to the easing of panic over the delivery specification into the ICE gasoil futures contract.\n",
      "Market focus remains firmly on the supply-side, with a view that any progress towards a ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine could lead to easing of heavy U.S. sanctions on Russian producers. The Trump administration has drafted a new 19-point peace plan that’s far more favorable to Ukraine compared to the original 28-point plan. Some of the critical amendments in the new plan include no handover of the Donbas region to Russia for free, no automatic veto on Ukraine joining NATO in the future, and provision of Article 5-style protection for Ukraine, meaning the U.S. would be bound to intervene if Russia invades in the future. A proposal for full amnesty for war crimes that was part of the first plan has also been removed.\n",
      "Related: OPEC+ Expected to Extend Pause on Oil Hikes as Prices Stay Weak\n",
      "China remains the leading buyer of Russian crude, with imports increasing by 275.6 kb/d over the past two months to ~2.15 mb/d. Overall, China’s crude imports have increased by 866 kb/d Y/Y to 11.44 mb/d as the country continues to stockpile crude. Rystad Energy estimates that China has stockpiled more than 1 million barrels of crude per day in some months, socking away nearly 160 million barrels in the first nine months of 2025. The buying spree has been triggered by strategic concerns like energy security and potential conflicts, as well as taking advantage of low oil prices. China is expected to continue stockpiling crude oil at least through 2026, supported by new laws and infrastructure development that allow for greater storage capacity, though some analysts suggest the pace might slow as storage limits are reached.\n",

      "Potential U.S. intervention in Venezuela has also added to the bearish sentiment after the Trump administration designated Cartel de los Soles, which it alleges is led by President Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. The US’ Operation Southern Spear has been targeting boats suspected of trafficking drugs in the region, with the hawks linking the moves to Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the largest of any country.\n",
      "Venezuelan oil production has been on a sharp decline since 2017, with a slew of sanctions prohibiting its access to financial markets. However, production has been slowly rising, from 360 kb/d in 2020 to around 1 mb/d currently, supported by black-market sales. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that it will take years before the South American country can hit peak production of around 2.5 mb/d that it achieved in the 2011-2015 period thanks to years of underinvestment in maturing oil fields as well as a lack of exploration drilling. Shortages of equipment, supplies and labour have also taken a toll on Venezuela’s energy sector. Further, the country is likely to have a hard time attracting fresh capital after the ConocoPhilips (NYSE:COP) debacle. The Venezuelan government under the late Hugo Chávez, and continued under Nicolás Maduro, expropriated ConocoPhillips' oil assets in 2007 during a wave of nationalizations of foreign oil investments. This led to  ConocoPhillips receiving two major international arbitration awards totaling over $8 billion. Venezuela's attempts to annul the awards have failed, and ConocoPhillips is now pursuing legal avenues to enforce the rulings and collect the compensation from Venezuela's remaining overseas assets, such as those related to the Citgo refinery.\n",

This marks the largest weekly fall in inventories since late February 2025. Recent cold weather has not supported prices, and there are now mild forecasts for the rest of December.\n",
      "In contrast, U.S. gas prices have continued rallying, with gas futures hitting $4.6/MMBtu on falling inventories coupled with expectations of higher demand. Weather forecasts suggest temperatures will remain mostly below normal over the next two weeks, boosting demand. Further, U.S. LNG exports are rising, with flows averaging a record 18 bcfd in November, up from October’s 16.6 bcfd.\n",

      "Hawaii’s Return to Gas Puts Energy Reliability in the Spotlight\n",
      "Oilprice.com \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hawaii-return-gas-puts-energy-220000247.html\n",
      "Irina Slav\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 5:00 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Hawaii has a plan to generate all of its energy from low-emission sources by 2045. It is a bold plan, as the state’s administration admits, and it is also a plan that will see Hawaii start importing liquefied natural gas.\n",
      "Hawaiians pay the highest electricity rates in the United States. They pay even more than Californians, who also have an administration with significant ambitions in the net-zero transition. With Hawaii, however, the reasons for the high rates include its geographical isolation, which makes it necessary to ship fuel oil for its power supply, adding to the final cost of the electricity produced with this fuel oil.\n",
      "Indeed, the final cost of baseload electricity in Hawaii is so high that locals pay the highest electricity bills even though they consume the least grid-delivered electricity in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration. At the same time, also per the EIA, “Despite having the third-lowest total energy consumption among the states, Hawaii uses 16 times more energy than it produces.”\n",
      "Hawaii, then, is not in the most enviable position with regard to energy supply, especially reliable, baseload supply. It gets close to a quarter of its electricity from solar panels, although the data sheets noting this information do not mention the fact that this is not a consistent, round-the-clock supply. It does have some battery storage, including a large-scale installation with a capacity of 185 MW. This is nowhere near enough to cover demand. The island state’s administration closed its last coal-powered plant three years ago.\n",
      "Related: Indian’s Serentica Renewables to Invest $11 Billion in Clean Energy\n",
      "Hawaii’s previous administration was dead set against natural gas in view of the 100% low-carbon energy goal. The current administration is more flexible, so it recently signed a preliminary deal with Japan’s JERA for long-term delivery of liquefied natural gas. Switching to gas-powered generation is expected to lower costs, especially over the long term, once Hawaii builds LNG import infrastructure.\n",
      "Advocates of zero-hydrocarbon generation are protesting the plans. Their arguments come down to that same 100% low-carbon generation goal, even though electricity costs have been climbing in tune with the phase-out of coal and the growth in solar. To net-zero advocates, any reliance on hydrocarbons is a step off the right track to net zero. More practical minds, however, note that energy affordability is a serious concern worth prioritizing.\n",
      "What is happening in Hawaii is quite similar to what is happening in Germany, which could serve as a cautionary tale to anyone planning a net-zero transition from hydrocarbons to weather-based sources of electricity. Germany also has firm net-zero plans in place that focus on the buildout of massive wind and solar generation capacity. Because this capacity depends on the weather, the country needs substantial baseload backup; and for that, it needs gas.\n",
      "Germany has been building LNG import capacity at breakneck speed to replace shunned Russian pipeline supply, in evidence that its massive wind and solar capacity cannot handle demand on its own, even with batteries. Like Hawaii, Germany plans to switch from gas to hydrogen at some distant point in the future, if green hydrogen ever starts making economic sense. In the meantime, however, it’s either gas or blackouts.\n",
      "One might point out that this sort of dilemma is a no-brainer.

      "Hawaii has a plan to generate all of its energy from low-emission sources by 2045. It is a bold plan, as the state’s administration admits, and it is also a plan that will see Hawaii start importing liquefied natural gas.\n",
      "Hawaiians pay the highest electricity rates in the United States. They pay even more than Californians, who also have an administration with significant ambitions in the net-zero transition. With Hawaii, however, the reasons for the high rates include its geographical isolation, which makes it necessary to ship fuel oil for its power supply, adding to the final cost of the electricity produced with this fuel oil.\n",
      "Indeed, the final cost of baseload electricity in Hawaii is so high that locals pay the highest electricity bills even though they consume the least grid-delivered electricity in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration. At the same time, also per the EIA, “Despite having the third-lowest total energy consumption among the states, Hawaii uses 16 times more energy than it produces.”\n",
      "Hawaii, then, is not in the most enviable position with regard to energy supply, especially reliable, baseload supply. It gets close to a quarter of its electricity from solar panels, although the data sheets noting this information do not mention the fact that this is not a consistent, round-the-clock supply. It does have some battery storage, including a large-scale installation with a capacity of 185 MW. This is nowhere near enough to cover demand. The island state’s administration closed its last coal-powered plant three years ago.\n",
      "Related: Indian’s Serentica Renewables to Invest $11 Billion in Clean Energy\n",
      "Hawaii’s previous administration was dead set against natural gas in view of the 100% low-carbon energy goal. The current administration is more flexible, so it recently signed a preliminary deal with Japan’s JERA for long-term delivery of liquefied natural gas. Switching to gas-powered generation is expected to lower costs, especially over the long term, once Hawaii builds LNG import infrastructure.\n",
      "Advocates of zero-hydrocarbon generation are protesting the plans. Their arguments come down to that same 100% low-carbon generation goal, even though electricity costs have been climbing in tune with the phase-out of coal and the growth in solar. To net-zero advocates, any reliance on hydrocarbons is a step off the right track to net zero. More practical minds, however, note that energy affordability is a serious concern worth prioritizing.\n",
      "What is happening in Hawaii is quite similar to what is happening in Germany, which could serve as a cautionary tale to anyone planning a net-zero transition from hydrocarbons to weather-based sources of electricity. Germany also has firm net-zero plans in place that focus on the buildout of massive wind and solar generation capacity. Because this capacity depends on the weather, the country needs substantial baseload backup; and for that, it needs gas.\n",
      "Germany has been building LNG import capacity at breakneck speed to replace shunned Russian pipeline supply, in evidence that its massive wind and solar capacity cannot handle demand on its own, even with batteries. Like Hawaii, Germany plans to switch from gas to hydrogen at some distant point in the future, if green hydrogen ever starts making economic sense. In the meantime, however, it’s either gas or blackouts.\n",
      "One might point out that this sort of dilemma is a no-brainer. Yet those dedicated to net zero argue that Hawaii—again like Germany—could get “hooked” on gas and be unable to wean itself off it by 2045. In the end, it comes down to priorities: deciding whether it is more important to have an uninterrupted, affordable electricity supply or have an intermittent, expensive supply and lower emissions.
