      "Black Friday is dying. Here’s what’s killing it in 2025\n",

      "Brian O'Connell\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 5:00 PM GMT+7\n",
      "There’s a good case to be made that Black Friday, as a holiday retail powerhouse, is losing its luster. While not dead yet, the day is showing major signs of wear and tear.\n",
      "In 2025, only 20% of consumers plan to start their holiday shopping on Black Friday weekend, with 59% starting earlier and 22% shopping after or at the last minute, according to cross-channel marketing platform Cordial.\n",
      "\"Black Friday’s dominance has waned,” said Rob Garf, head of strategy and insights at Cordial. Retailers hoping for an early surge are often caught in a game of “discount chicken, waiting for consumers to act as consumers wait for deeper price cuts. The data tells us the 'Black Friday blitz' strategy is misaligned with how most consumers shop today.”\n",
      "Multiple factors have brought Black Friday to its knees in 2025. Here’s a snapshot.\n",
      "According to global clickstream data provider Datos, AI-driven discovery is rising fast. “The share of visits coming from AI chat platforms nearly doubled year-over-year (from 1–4% in 2024 to 5–8% in 2025),” the company said in a new report. “Over 55% of AI-generated prompts leading to Amazon contained purchase intent, showing that predictive, conversational search is already influencing purchase decisions.”\n",
      "Retail experts say dynamic pricing and early “soft launch” discounts now replace one-day blowouts.\n",
      "“The prevalence of e-commerce has made deals and discounts more accessible and routine, causing marquee events like Black Friday to weaken,” said Greg Zakowicz, a retail analyst at Omnisend. “Because shoppers no longer have to wait for a singular day to take advantage of sales, their purchasing has become spread throughout the season.”\n",
      "Some retailers may view this as a negative, but Zakowicz sees the glass as half full. “One benefit is that because purchases are spread out, consumers have a greater likelihood of exceeding their gift budget,” he noted.\n",
      "The rise of e-commerce and logistics automation has also accelerated the decline of the traditional doorbuster era.\n",
      "“With warehouse automation and smart routing, retailers can meet massive online demand without the in-store rush,” said Sudip Mazumder, retail industry lead at Publicis Sapient, a technology and digital information company. “Physical stores have become fulfillment hubs rather than battlegrounds for bargain hunters, reflecting a broader transformation of retail from store-centered hype to data-driven precision.”\n",
      "----\n",
      "Retailers have also reengineered their Black Friday playbook, trading volume-driven promotions for supply-chain-led profitability,” Mazumder noted. “AI now drives discounting, clearing inventory with minimal markdowns and maximizing margins,” he said. “Success is no longer about foot traffic but about how efficiently retailers manage fulfillment and inventory.”\n",
      "By smoothing demand and optimizing logistics, retailers “are avoiding costly last-minute shipping crunches and sustaining profits across a longer holiday season,” Mazumder added.\n",
      "Retailers have figured out that pouring resources into a single shopping day pales in comparison to offering regular customer discounts and deals.\n",
      "“More and more brands are picking their own sales windows and building rituals around membership,” said Charlie Casey, CEO and co-founder of LoyaltyLion, an e-commerce customer loyalty and engagement company.\n",
      "For example, Casey cited skincare services company Inkey List, which runs “Insiders Week” with member-only pricing, double points, scratch cards, and tiered freebies. “That week delivered loyalty’s highest weekly contribution to revenue at 41%, with members spending three-times more and program sign-ups more than doubling,” Casey said. “It’s Amazon-Prime logic applied to your own calendar, away from the Black Friday and Cyber Monday dogfight.”\n",
      "Casey said he’s also seeing members-only bundles and rolling perks that hit monthly. “The effect is the same as a perpetual 'Cyber Month,' but curated for your base rather than a one-day stampede,” he noted. “When paired with zero-party data, this can be personalized so it feels special.”\n",
      "By and large, the global retail sector is moving toward a continuous commerce model rather than banner shopping days.\n",
      "“Instead of one major sales day, shoppers see a steady flow of personalized offers, loyalty rewards, and smaller, data-driven promotions throughout the season,” said Bess Devenow, senior manager of strategic communications and insights at Vantage. “While consumers may be more discerning while shopping this year, the holidays will remain a resilient retail ritual, one of the few times when emotion, tradition, and commerce intersect in a way that defines consumer behavior year after year.”\n",
      "Devenow said that Black Friday can still exist as a helpful reminder on when and how to get deals and streamline the gift-buying process, but not as a singular, one-day event.\n",
      "“This holiday season will favor retailers who make shopping feel seamless, personalized, and genuinely helpful from October through late December,” she said. “The excitement may have shifted, but the spirit of value hunting for consumers is still very much alive.”\n",
      "Other retail experts say the traditional version of Black Friday, defined by one-day doorbusters and crowded stores, has largely run its course.\n",
      "“It no longer fits how consumers shop,” said Ben Hussey, co-CEO at Katana Cloud Inventory, a business processes software company. “However, the event itself remains relevant in a new form. Black Friday continues to be one of the season’s highest-selling periods, but now functions as part of a longer, digitally driven cycle.”\n",
      "Retailers are still planning for the late-November surge, but the strategy has changed. “Now, the emphasis has shifted toward dynamic pricing, online convenience, and maintaining profitability through smarter supply chain management,” Hussey noted.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi used a call with the French president’s diplomatic adviser to say the two sides needed to support each other, underscoring Beijing’s push to win diplomatic backing during a spat with Japan.\n",
      "Wang said in the exchange Thursday with Emmanuel Bonne that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had “made provocative remarks related to Taiwan” this month.\n",

      "DC Mayor Bowser Won’t Seek Reelection in 2026\n",
      "Beijing and Paris should “firmly support each other on issues involving each other’s core interests,” Wang said, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry in Beijing. “I hope that the French side will continue to firmly abide by the One China principle.”\n",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is due to make a state visit to China next week, and hold discussions on economic and commercial matters.\n",
      "An official at Macron’s Elysee Palace said Thursday that Paris is consistent in supporting the One China policy — the recognition that the mainland and Taiwan make up a single nation governed by Beijing — and calls for the status quo to be respected.\n",
      "In light of the Japanese prime minister’s statements, France is urging everyone to adhere to this position, since it guarantees stability and ensures there’s no escalation around Taiwan.\n",
      "That also requires China to refrain from escalating the situation following Takaichi’s remarks, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing internal deliberations. France calls for tensions to be eased and for a return to a consensual approach that respects the status quo.\n",
      "Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, declined to comment on Wang’s outreach to France at a regular press conference on Friday afternoon. “We will continue to explain and communicate Japan’s views through various opportunities,” he said.\n",
      "Beijing kept up pressure on Takaichi, with a commentary in the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship newspaper saying Japan has yet to show remorse and still refused to retract its “erroneous” remarks. The People’s Daily article on Friday said the prime minister’s comments amounted to a serious provocation to China’s sovereignty.\n",
      "China has tried to rally diplomatic support during its dispute with Japan by sending a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last week accusing Takaichi of violating international law with comments that publicly linked a Taiwan Strait crisis with the possible deployment of Japanese troops.\n",
      "----\n",
      "The diplomatic push comes on top of other moves China has taken against Japan, such as economic reprisals and ramped up rhetoric.\n",
      "Takaichi spoke with Macron on Nov. 23 to reaffirm their partnership. The two countries have been working on a reciprocal access agreement to facilitate joint training between their militaries, according to Japan’s Foreign Ministry.\n",
      "As fellow members of the Group of Seven leading democracies, the two have shown unity in opposing any unilateral attempts by the likes of Beijing to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait by force or coercion.\n",
      "Takaichi has refused China’s demand to retract the remarks she made on Nov. 7 that linked Japan’s security to a Taiwan contingency, the first such instance for a sitting prime minister.\n",
      "This week, Takaichi said she didn’t intend to get specific on Taiwan and reiterated the government’s position on responding to regional contingencies — namely, that for any incident, Japan would make a judgment taking into account all relevant information.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Trading of futures and options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was halted by a data-center fault, causing hours of disruption to markets across equities, foreign exchange, bonds and commodities.\n",
      "The malfunction is already longer than a similar, hours-long outage due to a technical error back in 2019 and underscores the reach of CME Group and its Globex electronic trading platform. It triggered widespread frustration as market participants contemplated the prospect of a lost trading session.\n",

      "“It’s a bit like flying dark,” said Thomas Helaine, head of equity sales at TP ICAP Europe in Paris. “When you’re trading cash equity like us, US futures give you an indication of where the market is going before the open. I can only imagine how complicated it must be for derivatives desks.”\n",
      "Millions of contracts tracking the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 trade every weekday virtually around the clock on the CME, one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges. A spokesman for the group confirmed the outage was due to cooling issues at data centers run by CyrusOne, a Dallas-headquartered operator, but did not provide an estimated reopen time.\n",
      "The outage halted trading of US Treasury futures, while European and UK bond markets that trade on a different exchange were unaffected. EBS, a platform used in foreign exchange, was impacted, hurting price discovery in the market.\n",
      "For some traders, the timing of the disruption on Friday could cause particular inconvenience if it lasts, due to the need to roll positions from one monthly contract to another.\n",
      "Gold saw erratic moves in early London trading, with the gap between bids and offers about 20 times wider than normal. US crude oil and palm oil on the Bursa Malaysia exchange were also affected. In commodities markets, Friday is the expiry day for gasoline and diesel futures that can be settled with delivery of the actual physical fuel, adding a further potential complication.\n",
      "Angry Traders\n",
      "“Traders sitting with a position are certainly quite angry,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, head of trading and hedging strategies at Kaleesuwari Intercontinental.\n",
      "Others reported that volumes had shifted onto alternative, operational platforms as liquidity and price transparency evaporated.\n",
      "“Traders will be switching to alternative liquidity tools where they can,” said Nick Twidale, chief analyst at AT Global Markets in Sydney. “We’ve lost one of the market’s major liquidity sources. This heightens the risk of exacerbated moves if a big event occurs.”\n",
      "----\n",
      "Most US markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, and are due to reopen later for a shortened trading day. Thankfully for traders, there is limited news expected on Friday with no economic data scheduled for release in the US, and there are no expected Federal Reserve speakers ahead of a blackout period leading up to their anticipated December decision.\n",
      "November has been a volatile month for equities, with the S&P 500 slumping as much as 4.7% amid concerns about the path of Fed rate cuts and valuations about artificial intelligence-linked stocks. The index has clawed back those losses and volatility has been falling all week, back near October lows. The US stock benchmark is close to erasing its monthly drop with one more session left before the final month of the year.\n",
      "Bourses operated by CME include the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange. CME also has a stake in other exchanges, including the Gulf Mercantile Exchange, which said in a notice to the market that it had also seen trade halted due to the cooling issue.\n",

      "Gross domestic product is expected to expand 3.54% in 2026, according to a statement from the statistics bureau in Taipei on Friday. That compares with the previous forecast of 2.81% back in August. Exports were projected to grow 6.32% for the year, versus an earlier call of 2.19%.\n",
      "The bureau also said the economy was expected to grow by 7.37% in 2025, compared to the previous forecast of 4.45%. The new figure would be the fastest expansion since 2010.\n",
      "“As long as companies are building the AI infrastructure, demand for Taiwan’s tech products will continue to be there,” Tsai Yu-tai, head of statistics for the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, said at a briefing.\n",
      "The new estimates come as debate mounts over the business prospects for companies linked to the AI revolution. Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported its slowest monthly revenue growth in more than a year. The main chipmaker to AI leader Nvidia Corp. posted a 16.9% rise in sales for October, which did roughly track with the average analyst estimate.\n",
      "Taiwan’s economy has benefited from roaring exports this year. In October, outbound shipments surged at the fastest pace since 2010, largely due to massive demand for the chips and servers powering AI. Shipments to the US skyrocketed 144.3% to a record — underscoring Taiwan’s key role in the tech supply chain as companies like Meta Platforms Inc. and OpenAI race to build AI infrastructure.\n",
      "The statistics bureau also said GDP was expected to grow by 8.21% in the third quarter, versus its earlier estimate of 7.64%.\n",
      "Bumki Son, economist at Barclays Bank Plc, described this forecast as “another big upside surprise.”\n",
      "“This likely makes Taiwan the fastest growing economy in EM Asia in our coverage universe” for 2025, Son added.\n",
      "Roaring tech exports have eased worries about US President Donald Trump’s trade war. Many analysts had worried that tariffs would hit Taiwan’s economy, especially in the second half of 2025 but since many tech goods have mostly been exempted from the duties, that hasn’t come to pass.\n",
      "The Trump administration hit Taiwan with a 20% tariff rate on July 31 — a level that is higher than what the US has levied on South Korea and Japan. Officials in Taiwan have indicated they are trying to clinch a better deal with Washington but that has proven elusive so far.\n",

      "JP Morgan Asset Management’s Iain Stealey said the sales had created a bit of “a shock and some temporary indigestion,” and he reckons investment-grade spreads are about 10 basis points wider as a result. But he told the conference on Thursday that broader fears were overdone.\n",
      "“Yes, there has been a lot of issuance, but these are enormous companies producing significant earnings every year,” said Stealey, who is chief investment officer of international fixed income at the asset manager. “It’s not yet at a point where we should be overly concerned. In fact, some of the concessions offered on recent deals make them quite compelling opportunities, especially given the very high quality of the issuers involved.”\n",
      "Stealey believes future supply should be more evenly spaced. Meta has already indicated it likely won’t issue again until the second half of next year, he said.\n",
      "In addition, the fact that the big tech companies have very little debt means that they are attractive as credit, said Mahesh Bhimalingam, global head of credit strategy at Bloomberg Intelligence. He pointed out Alphabet has a better credit rating than France, while other firms such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. would also stand out among higher-rated names if tapping the market in Europe.\n",
      "“So when they do come in, I think there’s going to be a massive bid,” he said.\n",
      "Credit Positive\n",
      "Speakers at the conference struck an upbeat tone on credit overall, arguing that carry and healthy balance sheets would be supportive in 2026.\n",
      "“Yields remain very attractive, which makes moving up in quality a sensible strategy,” said Ashwin Palta, global high-yield portfolio manager at BNY Investments Newton. “You’re being paid appropriately for that level of risk, whereas lower-quality names aren’t offering enough spread pickup to justify reaching down the credit curve.”\n",
      "He added that in terms of subordination, Additional Tier 1, Restricted Tier 1 and hybrids looked appealing, particularly compared with Double B high yield.\n",
      "----\n",
      "AT1 bonds have been one of the strongest performers this year so far, with returns topping 10% year-to-date, and speakers at a later panel on this subject said they expect this to continue in 2026.\n",
      "“Probably we are at peak asset quality, but we start from a relatively good position, so I probably would say ‘more of the same’,” said Filippo Maria Alloatti, head of financials credit at Federated Hermes.\n",
      "The best upside in this space is in the smaller banks issuing bonds, according to Jackie Ineke, chief investment officer of Spring Investments.\n",
      "She said, for example, that Metro Bank Holdings Plc’s AT1 bonds carry less risk than many larger lenders. The British challenger bank has seen its shares and bonds recover sharply after it emerged it would be a beneficiary of Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ deregulation push across the City of London. It was also recently upgraded by Fitch Ratings after it returned to profitability in the first half of 2025.\n",
      "Ineke said there’s more risk associated with some larger investment banks than with Metro Bank after “where it’s been and where it’s going.”\n",

      "The number of cars rolling off the production line in October fell almost 24pc to 59,010 compared to the same month last year, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed on Friday.\n",

      "The automotive industry has dealt with a number of blows in the past year, with inflation resulting in consumers delaying or cancelling plans to buy cars and an increase in competition from China driving a push in global exports, especially for electric vehicles.\n",

      "Bullion was near $4,160 an ounce on Friday, up more than 2% for the week. A series of comments by Federal Reserve officials and the release of delayed economic data have supported the case for lower borrowing costs, which typically benefit gold as it doesn’t pay interest. Swap traders are pricing in a more-than-80% chance of a quarter-point cut in December.\n",
      "Traders will be digesting every last clue for the next rate decision before the US central bank goes into an external communication blackout starting Saturday. A record-setting government shutdown has delayed key data, and some statistics will not be released at all, making it challenging for the Fed and investors to assess the state of the world’s largest economy.\n",
      "Bullion has gained nearly every month this year, and is on track for its best annual performance since 1979. Elevated central-bank buying as well as robust non-sovereign inflows to exchange-traded funds supported the metal’s run to a record above $4,380 last month. Investors have piled into alternative assets in a wider retreat from government bonds and currencies.\n",
      "The precious metal has consolidated above the $4,000-an-ounce level this month since pulling back from its peak. For the last four weeks, inflows to gold-backed ETFs have been flat, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n",
      "Gold rose 0.1% to $4,161.58 an ounce as of 8:41 a.m. in London. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index added 0.1%. Platinum jumped 2%, while palladium fell 1.5%. Silver advanced as much as 1.5%, approaching the record high set last month, supported by ongoing supply tightness.\n",

      "John Liu, CNN\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 3:36 PM GMT+7\n",
      "For proof that an economy can thrive even under constant military threats from a powerful neighbor and amid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, look no further than Taiwan.\n",
      "The self-ruled democracy has logged roughly 8% economic growth for two consecutive quarters, a rare achievement for a developed economy and one that is projected to push its 2025 GDP growth close to 7.4%, even surpassing China’s.\n",
      "“Taiwan’s economy has clearly been one of the best performing economies in the world, particularly over recent quarters,” said Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics. “Many people expected Taiwan’s economy to benefit from the sort of AI boom, but maybe many underestimated to what extent it would do.”\n",
      "Taiwan’s statistics bureau on Friday reported 8.21% year-on-year growth in GDP in the third quarter, driven by a 36.5% surge in exports in the period ending September. This followed an already striking 7.7% expansion in the second quarter.\n",
      "In October, exports hit a record high, climbing 49.7% from a year earlier – the largest single month increase in over 15 years.\n",
      "To top it all off, Taiwan’s stock market overtook Germany’s in September as the world’s eighth largest, riding on the global frenzy for artificial intelligence.\n",
      "But even as Taiwan’s economy flourishes, driven by the outsized influence of its high-tech sector as exemplified by the world-beating chipmaker TSMC, many citizens have been unable to share in the boom, as income gaps widen and wages remain stagnant.\n",
      "Economists say a key reason is that the gains are highly concentrated. Electronics manufacturing accounts for more than 15% of GDP but employs just 6.5% of the workforce, according to Capital Economics.\n",
      "This unevenness is partly reflected in sluggish consumer spending. Consumer confidence has remained subdued throughout the year, according to the index released by the Research Center of Taiwan Economic Development. Trump’s trade war has also dampened sentiment, economists say, particularly as Taiwan has yet to finalize a trade agreement with Washington.\n",
      "“From my perspective as a salaried worker earning above the median income, I feel the economy isn’t actually doing that well,” said Vivian Chen, a nurse in the Southern port city of Kaohsiung.\n",
      "Chen’s observations are echoed by many in the home of the global chip powerhouse. Taiwan’s GDP per capita is forecast to exceed $38,000 this year, outpacing South Korea and Japan. But its average wage lags both countries by at least 30%, according to CNN’s calculations of official data.\n",
      "Taiwan’s tech prowess, built over decades in the chip and electronics industries, has positioned the island to benefit from the AI boom. As tech giants from Google and OpenAI to Microsoft rush to build data centers powered by graphics processing units designed by Nvidia and AMD, Taiwanese companies have been at the forefront, manufacturing the semiconductors and servers essential for training AI models.\n",
      "----\n",
      "In one prominent example, TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker that supplies Nvidia and is known by locals as the “protector of the nation,” has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, driven by the explosive growth in AI, after surpassing sales expectations in previous quarters.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Taiwan’s outbound shipments to the US, where most of the AI data center expansions have occurred, have grown more than 63% in the first 10 months of this year, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance.\n",
      "But questions have mounted about the sustainability of this export-driven boom, especially amid concerns that the AI frenzy could cool.\n",
      "Taiwan’s export growth “will definitely come down next year,” said Wang Jiann-Chyuan, vice president of the semi-official thinktank Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research. He expects growth to retreat from about 30% in recent quarters to single digits, as this year’s surge makes further expansion harder.\n",
      "Adding to the uncertainty is Trump, Wang said. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US hit a record this year, raising the risk of scrutiny from a president who has made reducing trade deficits a central goal of his tariff campaign.\n",
      "So far, chips and electronics, which made up more than 73% of Taiwan’s exports, have been spared from the levy. While Trump has repeatedly threatened triple-digit tariffs on semiconductors, he has exempted companies, including TSMC, that build manufacturing facilities in the United States.\n",
      "Still, the heavy concentration of exports in the high-tech sector has amplified concerns about over-reliance on a single industry — or even a single company. While chips and electronics now account for nearly three-quarters of exports, up from roughly half five years ago, traditional sectors such as metals, machinery, and plastics have seen little growth or outright decline.\n",
      "For Wu Jieh-min, a researcher at Taiwan’s top research institute Academia Sinica, however, part of the concern about the island’s economic future are associated with many Taiwanese people’s deep-seated insecurity about its political status. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to absorb it by force, if necessary.\n",
      "“I think the cautious, on-edge mindset you see across Taiwanese society is very obvious, and I actually see it as something positive,” said Wu, whose research focuses on political economy and sociology.\n",
      "“We have to manage our own future very carefully, because even just surviving is already difficult for us,” he said.\n",
      "On the ground, some Taiwanese say the rosy headline figures don’t reflect their daily lives, like Chen, the nurse, who said salaries for health professionals feel stagnant.\n",
      "“That’s why you hear doctors complaining about being underpaid, and why so many nurses are leaving the country or the industry altogether,” Chen said.\n",
      "“People in Taiwan keep hyping themselves up, saying things like ‘We have TSMC,’ or boasting about how high the stock market is. But for many living here, their monthly pay stayed much the same,” she added.\n",
      "GT Lin, an AI engineer in Taipei, echoed that sentiment.\n",
      "“That’s why I’ve come to the conclusion that the country is strong, but the people aren’t necessarily wealthy,” he said.\n",
      "Taiwan’s real wage growth, adjusted for inflation, began to slow in the late 1990s and has remained stagnant since the early 2000s. Labor’s share of GDP peaked at about 50% in the 1990s and has since fallen to around 44%.\n",
      "Roy Ngerng, a Singaporean labor activist based in Taipei who has written extensively about the issue of wage stagnation in Taiwan, attributed the problem to long-term wage suppression — aimed at boosting export competitiveness.\n",
      "He said that while Taiwan’s economy has seen exceptional growth in recent years – and booming profits among tech businesses – average workers and employees in other sectors have been mostly left out, widening the income disparity.\n",
      "Just five years ago, wages in the electronics sector were already 35% above the economy-wide average, according to Capital Economics. Now they are more than 70% higher.\n",
      "Ngerng added that the current government has been steadily increasing the minimum wage.\n",
      "Wu Tsong-Min, an economist at National Taiwan University, however, notes that wage stagnation is “not unique to Taiwan,” as many advanced economies face similar issues, particularly among low-skill workers.\n",
      "Wu, the author of “A 400-Year History of Taiwan’s Economy,” also pointed out that Taiwan’s GDP per capita, after adjusted for purchasing power, rises further thanks to lower domestic prices.\n",
      "Still, housing remains a major burden: Taipei’s house price-to-income ratio has nearly tripled in the past two decades, surpassing London, New York and even Hong Kong, according to the Global Property Guide.\n",
      "For Wu of Academia Sinica, he remains optimistic, saying that the thriving tech industry could generate spillover effects that trickle down to other sectors.\n",
      "“Taiwan’s economy wasn’t shaped by deliberate planning or an exceptionally capable government, but rather an evolutionary process,” he said.\n",
      "While the size of Taiwan’s economy is dwarfed by leading global powers, Wu added, its small and medium-sized enterprises are nimble, adaptable and attuned to global trends.\n",
      "“That’s how its semiconductor industry became what it is today.”\n",

      "Boosted by a wave of analyst optimism and a wider equities rally, Siemens Energy AG shares are up by 13% this week and hovering near an all-time high, fully recouping last Friday’s 10% slump. That’s pushed the company’s market value to within touching distance of €100 billion ($116 billion).\n",
      "“Global electricity demand is rising, especially in markets Siemens Energy is in,” said Nikolas Demeter, an analyst at B Metzler Seel Sohn & Co AG, who upgraded the shares to buy on Monday. He added that the stock remains appealing due to an attractive valuation and the firm’s strong order backlog.\n",
      "The German company, spun off from industrial giant Siemens AG in 2020, was Europe’s best-performing stock in 2024, surging 320% on booming demand for data centers, a vital part of AI infrastructure. It’s climbed another 127% so far this year, and the upward momentum is expected to continue.\n",
      "More than a fifth of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have raised their price targets on the renewable energy company since it announced plans last week to buy back up to €6 billion of its own shares. The stock tumbled the following day as short-term investors took profits, amid broader market concerns as to whether heavy AI spending is delivering returns.\n",
      "Brokers have stayed upbeat. Berenberg analysts led by Richard Dawson were among those who raised their price targets, saying that while the broader data-center theme might cause share price volatility, earnings growth forecasts and the shareholder return framework means they “remain positive.”\n",
      "Earlier in November, Siemens Energy substantially lifted its mid-term financial targets on strong demand for gas turbines and data-center equipment as well as restructuring progress at its troubled Gamesa wind turbine unit.\n",
      "The firm is “building tomorrow’s energy infrastructure,” said Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by Gael de-Bray, who also raised their targets this week.\n",
      "In a show of durability, Siemens Energy is currently 2025’s best performer in a UBS basket of European AI stocks, set to extend its winning streak to a second year. It has shown resilience to the concerns that trouble other AI names.\n",
      "“In recent months, the correlation between AI stocks and Siemens Energy has been relatively high. Looking at this week, however, the picture has shifted somewhat,” Demeter said. “Siemens Energy has performed significantly better than Nvidia.”\n",
